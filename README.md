# diffdelta-site
diffDelta is a public, bot-first changefeed: The repo hosts the static, CDN-served JSON endpoints and JSON Schemas that define the diffDelta contract (diff feeds, per-source feeds, known issues with severity/scope, and the well-known discovery manifest). Designed for ingestion with quarantine-first risk handling, provenance, and schema evolution.
