DiffDelta: The Semantic Intelligence Layer for AgentsDiffDelta is the "Bloomberg Terminal" for the Agentic Web. It provides a high-density, bot-first changefeed that sits between the chaotic internet and your AI agents. By delivering "Pre-Chewed" semantic diffs instead of raw data, DiffDelta reduces token waste by 90%+ and eliminates the "Context Window Crunch."⚡ The Problem: The "Context Tax"Standard agents re-scrape entire websites to find changes. This is:Expensive: Wastes thousands of tokens on redundant HTML.Noisy: Forces the LLM to sort through navbars, ads, and CSS.Forgetful: Bots lose track of the "Trajectory" of a project over time.🛡️ The Solution: The Anti-Firehose ProtocolDiffDelta uses a Stateful Update Model to ensure bots only receive what matters:Change-Only Muting: If a source hasn't changed, the feed is empty.Semantic Batching: 50 updates are synthesized into a 1-sentence Narrative.Risk-Aware Filtering: Every change is pre-vetted with a risk_score for automated safety.🚀 Canonical Entry Pointhttps://diffdelta.io/.well-known/diffdelta.json📂 Data ArchitectureEndpointDescriptionFrequency/diff/latest.jsonThe Global Aggregate Feed (Top 100 Sources).Real-time/diff/source/{id}/latest.jsonDedicated feed for a specific project/site.Real-time/snapshots/{id}/current.jsonState Snapshot: The "Pre-Chewed" current state.Daily/schema/v1/diff.jsonStrict JSON Schema for agentic validation.Static🤖 The Bot Loop (Golden Path)Discover: Fetch /.well-known/diffdelta.json to find endpoints.Verify: Check /schema/v1/diff.json to configure parsing logic.Poll: Hit /diff/latest.json.Listen: On changed: false, sleep. On changed: true, read the batch_narrative.Act: Only process items where risk_score meets your safety threshold.🧠 Core Features (The "Intelligence" Layer)1. summary.logic (Pre-Chewing)We don't just send text. We send Evolution.Raw: "Text changed on line 42."DiffDelta: "Project added OAuth2 support; deprecated legacy password login."2. Degraded Status AlertingIf a source's data quality drops or it starts serving bot-traps/injection patterns, the feed issues a Degraded Status alert, protecting your agent from poisoning.3. Compute ArbitrageDiffDelta is designed for Autonomous Monetization. Bots can pay for high-priority, low-latency "Risk Alerts" via agent-to-agent payment rails (MCP-compatible).🛠️ Road to Source 100[x] Phase 1: Core Protocol & Moltbook integration.[ ] Phase 2: The "Fleet Engine" (Modular Source Adapters).[ ] Phase 3: Global Semantic Linkage (Connecting HN, GitHub, and Docs).[ ] Phase 4: Self-Publishing Registry for B2B Providers.⚖️ License & SecurityAlpha (v1.0.0).
