Later when snd_card_register() runs,\nthe OSS mixer layer calls their callbacks and hits a use-after-free read.\n\nCall trace:\n  get_ctl_value+0x63f/0x820 sound/usb/mixer.c:411\n  get_min_max_with_quirks.isra.0+0x240/0x1f40 sound/usb/mixer.c:1241\n  mixer_ctl_feature_info+0x26b/0x490 sound/usb/mixer.c:1381\n  snd_mixer_oss_build_test+0x174/0x3a0 sound/core/oss/mixer_oss.c:887\n  ...\n  snd_card_register+0x4ed/0x6d0 sound/core/init.c:923\n  usb_audio_probe+0x5ef/0x2a90 sound/usb/card.c:1025\n\nFix by calling snd_ctl_remove() for all mixer controls before freeing\nid_elems.

These race conditions can\ncause the SCSI layer to fail to wake the error handler, leaving I/O\nthrough the SCSI host stuck as the error state cannot advance.\n\nFirst, there is an memory ordering issue within scsi_dec_host_busy().\nThe write which clears SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT may be reordered with reads\ncounting in scsi_host_busy(). While the local CPU will see its own\nwrite, reordering can allow other CPUs in scsi_dec_host_busy() or\nscsi_eh_inc_host_failed() to see a raised busy count, causing no CPU to\nsee a host busy equal to the host_failed count.\n\nThis race condition can be prevented with a memory barrier on the error\npath to force the write to be visible before counting host busy\ncommands.\n\nSecond, there is a general ordering issue with scsi_eh_inc_host_failed(). By\ncounting busy commands before incrementing host_failed, it can race with a\nfinal command in scsi_dec_host_busy(), such that scsi_dec_host_busy() does\nnot see host_failed incremented but scsi_eh_inc_host_failed() counts busy\ncommands before SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT is cleared by scsi_dec_host_busy(),\nresulting in neither waking the error handler task.\n\nThis needs the call to scsi_host_busy() to be moved after host_failed is\nincremented to close the race condition.\n\nThe Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23110 to this issue.\n\n\nAffected and fixed versions\n===========================\n\n\tIssue introduced in 5.5 with commit 6eb045e092efefafc6687409a6fa6d1dabf0fb69 and fixed in 6.6.122 with commit 9fdc6f28d5e81350ab1d2cac8389062bd09e61e1\n\tIssue introduced in 5.5 with commit 6eb045e092efefafc6687409a6fa6d1dabf0fb69 and fixed in 6.12.68 with commit 64ae21b9c4f0c7e60cf47a53fa7ab68852079ef0\n\tIssue introduced in 5.5 with commit 6eb045e092efefafc6687409a6fa6d1dabf0fb69 and fixed in 6.18.8 with commit 219f009ebfd1ef3970888ee9eef4c8a06357f862\n\tIssue introduced in 5.5 with commit 6eb045e092efefafc6687409a6fa6d1dabf0fb69 and fixed in 6.19-rc7 with commit fe2f8ad6f0999db3b318359a01ee0108c703a8c3\n\nPlease see <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org\">https://www.kernel.org</a> for a full list of currently supported\nkernel versions by the kernel community.\n\nUnaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to\nolder supported kernel versions.

As the value of\n    SMCR_ELx.LEN may be larger than the task's streaming SVE vector\n    length, this may read memory outside of the task's allocated\n    sve_state, reading unrelated data and/or triggering a fault.\n\n    While this can result in secrets being loaded into streaming SVE\n    registers, these values are never exposed. As TIF_SME is clear,\n    fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() will configure CPACR_ELx.SMEN to trap EL0\n    accesses to streaming mode SVE registers, so these cannot be\n    accessed directly at EL0. As fpsimd_save_user_state() verifies the\n    live vector length before saving (S)SVE state to memory, no secret\n    values can be saved back to memory (and hence cannot be observed via\n    ptrace, signals, etc).\n\n    When the live vector length doesn't match the expected vector length\n    for the task, fpsimd_save_user_state() will send a fatal SIGKILL\n    signal to the task. Hence the task may be killed after executing\n    userspace for some period of time.\n\n(2) Restoring a context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM clear does not clear the\n    task's SVCR.SM. If SVCR.SM was set prior to restoring the context,\n    then the task will be left in streaming mode unexpectedly, and some\n    register state will be combined inconsistently, though the task will\n    be left in legitimate state from the kernel's PoV.\n\n    This can only occur in unusual (but legitimate) cases where ptrace\n    has been used to set SVCR.SM after entry to the sigreturn syscall,\n    as syscall entry clears SVCR.SM.\n\n    In these cases, the the provided SVE register data will be loaded\n    into the task's sve_state using the non-streaming SVE vector length\n    and the FPSIMD registers will be merged into this using the\n    streaming SVE vector length.\n\nFix (1) by setting TIF_SME when setting SVCR.SM. This also requires\nensuring that the task's sme_state has been allocated, but as this could\ncontain live ZA state, it should not be zeroed. Fix (2) by clearing\nSVCR.SM when restoring a SVE signal context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM clear.\n\nFor consistency, I've pulled the manipulation of SVCR, TIF_SVE, TIF_SME,\nand fp_type earlier, immediately after the allocation of\nsve_state/sme_state, before the restore of the actual register state.\nThis makes it easier to ensure that these are always modified\nconsistently, even if a fault is taken while reading the register data\nfrom the signal context. I do not expect any software to depend on the\nexact state restored when a fault is taken while reading the context.\n\nThe Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23102 to this issue.\n\n\nAffected and fixed versions\n===========================\n\n\tIssue introduced in 5.19 with commit 85ed24dad2904f7c141911d91b7807ab02694b5e and fixed in 6.18.8 with commit 7b5a52cf252a0d2e89787b645290ad288878f332\n\tIssue introduced in 5.19 with commit 85ed24dad2904f7c141911d91b7807ab02694b5e and fixed in 6.19-rc7 with commit d2907cbe9ea0a54cbe078076f9d089240ee1e2d9\n\nPlease see <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org\">https://www.kernel.org</a> for a full list of currently supported\nkernel versions by the kernel community.\n\nUnaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to\nolder supported kernel versions.

At least patch #1 and #4.\n\nPatch #1 fixes hugetlb_pmd_shared() not detecting any sharing\nPatch #2 + #3 are simple comment fixes that patch #4 interacts with.\nPatch #4 is a fix for the reported performance regression due to excessive\nIPI broadcasts during fork()+exit().\n\nThe last patch is all about TLB flushes, IPIs and mmu_gather.\nRead: complicated\n\nThere are plenty of cleanups in the future to be had + one reasonable\noptimization on x86. But that's all out of scope for this series.\n\nRuntime tested, with a focus on fixing the performance regression using\nthe original reproducer [2] on x86.\n\n\nThis patch (of 4):\n\nWe switched from (wrongly) using the page count to an independent shared\ncount.  Now, shared page tables have a refcount of 1 (excluding\nspeculative references) and instead use ptdesc-&gt;pt_share_count to identify\nsharing.\n\nWe didn't convert hugetlb_pmd_shared(), so right now, we would never\ndetect a shared PMD table as such, because sharing/unsharing no longer\ntouches the refcount of a PMD table.\n\nPage migration, like mbind() or migrate_pages() would allow for migrating\nfolios mapped into such shared PMD tables, even though the folios are not\nexclusive.  In smaps we would account them as \"private\" although they are\n\"shared\", and we would be wrongly setting the PM_MMAP_EXCLUSIVE in the\npagemap interface.\n\nFix it by properly using ptdesc_pmd_is_shared() in hugetlb_pmd_shared().\n\nThe Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23100 to this issue.\n\n\nAffected and fixed versions\n===========================\n\n\tIssue introduced in 6.13 with commit 59d9094df3d79443937add8700b2ef1a866b1081 and fixed in 6.18.8 with commit 69c4e241ff13545d410a8b2a688c932182a858bf\n\tIssue introduced in 6.13 with commit 59d9094df3d79443937add8700b2ef1a866b1081 and fixed in 6.19-rc7 with commit ca1a47cd3f5f4c46ca188b1c9a27af87d1ab2216\n\tIssue introduced in 5.10.239 with commit 94b4b41d0cdf5cfd4d4325bc0e6e9e0d0e996133\n\tIssue introduced in 5.15.186 with commit 8410996eb6fea116fe1483ed977aacf580eee7b4\n\tIssue introduced in 6.1.142 with commit 02333ac1c35370517a19a4a131332a9690c6a5c7\n\tIssue introduced in 6.6.72 with commit 56b274473d6e7e7375f2d0a2b4aca11d67c6b52f\n\tIssue introduced in 6.12.9 with commit 2e31443a0d18ae43b9d29e02bf0563f07772193d\n\nPlease see <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org\">https://www.kernel.org</a> for a full list of currently supported\nkernel versions by the kernel community.\n\nUnaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to\nolder supported kernel versions.

In the complete callback\nkvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted. In\nkvaser_usb_remove_interfaces() the URBs are freed by calling\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs(&amp;dev-&gt;rx_submitted).\n\nHowever, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors\nthe URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an\nin-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not\nreleased in usb_kill_anchored_urbs().\n\nFix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the\nkvaser_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev-&gt;rx_submitted anchor.\n\nThe Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23061 to this issue.\n\n\nAffected and fixed versions\n===========================\n\n\tIssue introduced in 3.8 with commit 080f40a6fa28dab299da7a652e444b1e2d9231e7 and fixed in 6.6.122 with commit 7c308f7530bffafa994e0aa8dc651a312f4b9ff4\n\tIssue introduced in 3.8 with commit 080f40a6fa28dab299da7a652e444b1e2d9231e7 and fixed in 6.12.68 with commit 94a7fc42e21c7d9d1c49778cd1db52de5df52a01\n\tIssue introduced in 3.8 with commit 080f40a6fa28dab299da7a652e444b1e2d9231e7 and fixed in 6.18.8 with commit 3b1a593eab941c3f32417896cc7df564191f2482\n\tIssue introduced in 3.8 with commit 080f40a6fa28dab299da7a652e444b1e2d9231e7 and fixed in 6.19-rc7 with commit 248e8e1a125fa875158df521b30f2cc7e27eeeaa\n\nPlease see <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org\">https://www.kernel.org</a> for a full list of currently supported\nkernel versions by the kernel community.\n\nUnaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to\nolder supported kernel versions.
