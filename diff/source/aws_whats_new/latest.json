These deployment strategies provide additional confidence during updates by allowing teams to observe application behavior at each traffic-shift step, and integrate with Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically stop or roll back deployments if issues are detected. This is especially valuable for workloads running behind an NLB, such as online gaming backends, financial transaction systems, and real-time messaging services.</p> \n<p>To get started, select your NLB target groups, listener, and preferred deployment strategy in the ECS service configuration using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools.

Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources, and understanding their dependencies is critical for maintaining secure and stable infrastructure.<br /> <br /> Previously, customers managing complex security group configurations had to navigate through multiple AWS services individually to identify dependencies before modifying or deleting security groups. This manual process required checking EC2 instances, Elastic Network Interfaces, ElastiCache clusters, RDS databases, and other services one by one, making it time-consuming and error-prone. The \"Related resources\" tab streamlines this workflow by displaying all dependent resources in a single location, enabling customers to quickly assess the impact of proposed changes and make informed decisions with confidence. This enhancement is beneficial for organizations managing large-scale deployments where security groups may be attached to dozens or hundreds of resources across different services.<br /> <br /> This feature is now available in all AWS commercial regions at no additional cost.<br /> <br /> To learn more about managing security groups and viewing the \"Related resources\" tab in the Amazon EC2 and VPC consoles, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html\">Amazon EC2 User Guide</a>.</p>",

This removes previous procurement barriers caused by complex payment remittance processes between different AWS entities, which made it difficult for EMEA customers to purchase Professional Services through AWS Marketplace.<br /> <br /> Key benefits include support for SEPA (Single Euro Payment Area) payment methods and invoicing consistency from the same AWS entity covering all AWS Marketplace purchases via AWS EMEA Marketplace Operator. This capability is ideal for EMEA customers purchasing consulting, implementation, or managed services through AWS Marketplace. It also benefits organizations that prefer local payment methods such as SEPA direct debit, want to consolidate AWS and Marketplace billing, or are seeking a simpler procurement experience for Professional Services.<br /> <br /> This capability is available for EMEA customers who purchase professional services solutions in AWS Marketplace, with AWS EMEA as the Marketplace Operator.

NVIDIA NIM™ provides prebuilt, optimized inference microservices for rapidly deploying the latest AI models on any NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure. These models bring advanced capabilities spanning protein design, reasoning with configurable outputs, and physical world understanding, enabling customers to accelerate biosciences research, drug discovery, and embodied AI applications on AWS infrastructure.</p> \n<p><b>ProteinMPNN </b>enables fast and efficient protein sequence optimization guided by structural data. This NIM generates high-quality sequences with enhanced binding affinity and stability, validated through experimental results. Designed for scalability and flexibility, ProteinMPNN integrates seamlessly into protein engineering workflows, transforming applications like enzyme design and therapeutic development.</p> \n<p><b>MSA Search NIM</b>&nbsp;supports GPU-accelerated Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of a query amino acid sequence against a set of protein sequence databases. These databases are searched for similar sequences to the query and then the collection of sequences are aligned to establish similar regions even when the proteins have different lengths and motifs.</p> \n<p><b>Nemotron-3.5B-Instruct</b>&nbsp;delivers high reasoning performance, native tool calling support, and extended context processing with 256k token context window. This model employs an efficient hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to ensure higher throughput than its predecessors for agentic and coding workloads, while maintaining the reasoning depth of a larger model.&nbsp;It is ideal for building multi-agent workflows, developer productivity tools, processes automation, and for scientific and mathematical reasoning analysis, amongst others.</p> \n<p><b>Cosmos Reason</b>&nbsp;is an open , customizable, reasoning vision language model (VLM) for physical AI and robotics. It enables robots and vision AI agents to reason like humans, using prior knowledge, physics understanding, and common sense to understand and act in the real world. This model understands space, time, and fundamental physics, and can serve as a planning model to reason what steps an embodied agent might take next.</p> \n<p>With SageMaker JumpStart, customers can deploy any of these models with just a few clicks to address their specific AI use cases.</p> \n<p>To get started with these models, navigate to the SageMaker JumpStart model catalog in the SageMaker console or use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy the models to your AWS account. For more information about deploying and using foundation models in SageMaker JumpStart, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html\">Amazon SageMaker JumpStart documentation</a>.</p>",

          "html": "<p>Amazon CloudFront announces support for mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for origins, a security protocol that enables customers to verify that requests to their origin servers come only from their authorized CloudFront distributions using TLS certificates. This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.<br /> <br /> Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins. These approaches required ongoing operational overhead to rotate secrets, update allow-lists, and maintain custom code. Now with origin mTLS support, customers can implement a standardized, certificate-based authentication approach that eliminates this operational burden. This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs. Customers can leverage client certificates issued by <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html\">AWS Private Certificate Authority</a> or third-party private Certificate Authorities, which they import through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/\">AWS Certificate Manager</a>.<br /> <br /> Customers can configure origin mTLS using the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, CDK, or CloudFormation. Origin mTLS is supported for all origins that support mutual TLS on AWS such as Application Load Balancer and API Gateway, as well as on-premises and custom origins. There is no additional charge for origin mTLS. Origin mTLS is also available in the Business and Premium flat-rate pricing plans. For detailed implementation guidance and best practices, visit the CloudFront origin <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-mtls-authentication.html\">mutual TLS documentation</a>.</p>",

This capability allows customers to quickly diagnose setup issues and take timely corrective actions to operate resilient data streaming workloads. This capability is available for both Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and self-managed Apache Kafka (SMK) event source mappings.<br /> <br /> Customers use Kafka event source mappings (ESM) with their Lambda functions to build mission-critical applications. However, the lack of visibility into event polling setup, scaling, and processing state for events slows down troubleshooting for issues resulting from faulty permissions, misconfiguration, or function errors, which increases mean time to resolution and adds operational overhead. With this launch, customers can enable CloudWatch Logs and metrics to monitor their Kafka polling setup, scaling, and event processing state. Customers can select from multiple log level options that provide logs ranging from warnings and errors to detailed information about event processing progress. Similarly, customers can enable one or more metrics groups—EventCount, ErrorCount, and KafkaMetrics—to monitor various aspects of event processing. Customers can view all their metrics and logs via a dedicated monitoring page on AWS Console for ESM. This capability allows customers to utilize their observability tooling to quickly diagnose setup issues and track performance metrics to meet their stringent business requirements.<br /> <br /> This feature is available in all AWS Commercial Regions where AWS Lambda's Provisioned mode for Kafka ESM is available.<br /> <br /> You can enable ESM logs and metrics for your Kafka ESM using AWS Lambda's Create and Update ESM APIs, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM.

With additional storage volumes, customers can add up to three storage volumes, each with up to 64 TiB, in addition to the primary storage volume for their database instance. As a result, customers get flexibility to add or remove storage with evolving workload demands, without incurring application downtime, and set up their database instance with up to 256 TiB storage. Now, with support for cross-Region replicas, customers that set up database instances with cross-Region replicas for business-critical applications also get the benefit of using additional storage volumes for storage flexibility.<br /> <br /> When you create a cross-Region replica for a database instance that is set up with additional storage volumes, Amazon RDS for Oracle automatically configures the same storage layout on the replica. Subsequently, you can apply changes to additional storage volumes on the primary instance and the replica using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a cross-Region replica to serve as the new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica to meet low recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for business critical applications.<br /> <br /> You will need an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use replicas in mounted mode, and an additional Oracle Active Data Guard license to use replicas in read-only mode. We recommend consulting your legal team or licensing expert to verify Oracle license requirements for your specific use case. Amazon RDS for Oracle cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes is available in all AWS Regions including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

For example, large group attributes from external SAML or OIDC identity providers that exceed Cognito’s 2,048 character limit per attribute can block the authentication flow. This capability allows you to add, override, or suppress attribute values, such as modifying large group attributes, before creating new federated users or updating existing federated user profiles in Cognito.</p> \n<p>The new inbound federation Lambda trigger is available through hosted UI (classic) and managed login in all AWS Regions where Amazon Cognito is available. To get started, configure the trigger using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation by adding the new&nbsp;parameter to your User Pool&nbsp;LambdaConfig.

This capability is available for tables in both provisioned and on-demand capacity modes, including multi-Region replicated tables.<br /> <br /> Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces is serverless, so you pay for only the resources that you use and you can build applications that serve thousands of requests per second with virtually unlimited throughput and storage.<br /> <br /> While Amazon Keyspaces automatically scales to accommodate growing workloads, certain scenarios like application launches, marketing campaigns, or seasonal events can create sudden traffic spikes that exceed normal scaling patterns. With pre-warming, you can now manually specify your expected peak throughput requirements during table creation or update operations, ensuring your tables are immediately ready to handle large traffic surges without scaling delays or increased error rates.<br /> <br /> The pre-warming process is non-disruptive and runs asynchronously, allowing you to continue making other table modifications while pre-warming is in progress. Pre-warming incurs a one-time charge based on the difference between your specified values and the baseline capacity. The feature is now available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where Amazon Keyspaces is offered.

A common requirement for these compliance frameworks is more rigorous encryption standards for data-at-rest, where organizations must encrypt data using a key management service. With UpdateObjectEncryption, customers can now change the encryption type of existing encrypted objects to move from Amazon S3 managed server-side encryption (SSE-S3) to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). You can also change the customer-managed KMS key used to encrypt your data to comply with custom key rotation standards or enable the use of S3 Bucket Keys to reduce your KMS requests.<br /> <br /> The Amazon S3 UpdateObjectEncryption API is available in all AWS Regions.

With these automated procedures, customers can deploy web applications to their AWS account using natural language prompts from any MCP-compatible IDE or CLI, including Kiro, Kiro CLI, Cursor, and Claude Code. Deployment works by generating AWS CDK infrastructure, deploying CloudFormation stacks, and creating CI/CD pipelines with recommended AWS security best practices.<br /> <br /> Previously, developers struggled to take their vibe-coded applications to production with DevOps best practices in place. Now, developers can move quickly from prototype to production in as little as one prompt. When you ask your AI assistant configured with AWS MCP Server to deploy your web application, your AI agent will follow the multi-step plan defined in Agent SOPs to analyze the project structure, generate CDK infrastructure, and deploy a preview environment hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. Once you are ready, it can configure AWS CodePipeline for automated production deployments from source repositories, setting up CI/CD automatically for your application. The Agent SOPs support web applications built with popular frameworks including React, Vue.js, Angular, and Next.js. Deployment documentation is automatically created in the repository, enabling agents to handle future deployments, query logs for troubleshooting and resume work across sessions.<br /> <br /> The Agent SOPs are available in preview as part of the AWS MCP Server at no additional cost in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You pay only for AWS resources you create and applicable data transfer costs.
