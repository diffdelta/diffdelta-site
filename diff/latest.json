Sonic 3 is Cartesia's latest state space model (SSM) for streaming text-to-speech (TTS), delivering high naturalness, accurate transcript following, and industry-leading latency with fine-grained control over volume, speed, and emotion.</p> \n<p>Sonic 3 supports 42 languages and provides advanced controllability through API parameters and SSML tags for volume, speed, and emotion adjustments. The model includes natural laughter support, stable voices optimized for voice agents, and emotive voices for expressive characters. With sub-100ms latency, Sonic 3 enables real-time conversational AI that captures human speech nuances including emotions and tonal shifts.<br /> <br /> With SageMaker JumpStart, customers can deploy Sonic 3 with just a few clicks to address their voice AI use cases. To get started with this model, navigate to the SageMaker JumpStart model catalog in the SageMaker Studio or use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy the model to your AWS account.

          "summary": "<p>AWS Multi-Party Approval now requires approvers to verify their voting actions with a one-time password (OTP) sent to their registered AWS Identity Center email address. This additional security layer prevents AWS IAM Identity Center administrators from bypassing multi-party approval controls by impersonating approvers through credential resets or authentication endpoint modifications. When approvers access the Approval Portal and attempt to cast their vote on protected operations, the system generates a six-digit verification code and sends it to their email. Approvers enter this code within 10 minutes to complete their vote, with up to three attempts allowed.<br /> <br /> The OTP verification process activates only when approvers submit their vote decision, they can review all approval request details before verification is required. If approvers don't receive the email or the code expires, they can request a new code through the interface.<br /> <br /> AWS Multi-party approval with OTP verification for voting is available in all AWS Regions where Mulit-party approval is offered at no additional charge.

This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.<br /> <br /> Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins.

This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs.

With this launch, customers can enable CloudWatch Logs and metrics to monitor their Kafka polling setup, scaling, and event processing state. Customers can select from multiple log level options that provide logs ranging from warnings and errors to detailed information about event processing progress.

As a result, customers get flexibility to add or remove storage with evolving workload demands, without incurring application downtime, and set up their database instance with up to 256 TiB storage.

Subsequently, you can apply changes to additional storage volumes on the primary instance and the replica using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a cross-Region replica to serve as the new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica to meet low recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for business critical applications.<br /> <br /> You will need an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use replicas in mounted mode, and an additional Oracle Active Data Guard license to use replicas in read-only mode.

With automatic scaling to and from zero instances, game developers using Amazon GameLift Servers can optimize their multiplayer gaming infrastructure costs while maintaining responsive performance.<br /> <br /> By eliminating charges for unused instances during inactive periods, while automatically scaling up when game sessions are requested, this new capability delivers significant cost savings for game developers.

Starting today, you can create new EKS clusters using version 1.35 and upgrade existing clusters to version 1.35 using the EKS console, the eksctl command line interface, or through an infrastructure-as-code tool.<br /> <br /> Kubernetes version 1.35 introduces several key improvements, including In-Place Pod Resource Updates allowing CPU and memory adjustments without restarting Pods, and PreferSameNode Traffic Distribution prioritizing local endpoints before routing to remote nodes for reduced latency. The release brings Node Topology Labels via Downward API enabling Pods to access region and zone information without API server queries, alongside Image Volumes delivering data artifacts like AI models using OCI container images. To learn more about the changes in Kubernetes version 1.35, see our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions-standard.html\">documentation</a> and the Kubernetes project <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.35.md\">release notes.</a><br /> <br /> EKS now supports Kubernetes version 1.35 in all the AWS Regions where EKS is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.<br /> <br /> You can learn more about the Kubernetes versions available on EKS and instructions to update your cluster to version 1.35 by visiting EKS documentation. You can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-insights.html\">EKS cluster insights</a> to check if there are any issues that can impact your Kubernetes cluster upgrades.

We decided to emit a deprecation warning instead.\r\n* Add [`FieldInfo.asdict()`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo.asdict) method, improve documentation around `FieldInfo` by @Viicos in [#12411](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12411).\r\n  This also adds back support for mutations on `FieldInfo` classes, that are reused as `Annotated` metadata. **However**, note that this is still *not* a supported pattern. Instead, please refer to the [added example](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/examples/dynamic_models/) in the documentation.\r\n\r\nThe [blog post](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-v2-12-release#changes) section on changes was also updated to document the changes related to `serialize_as_any`.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/compare/v2.12.2...v2.12.3",
