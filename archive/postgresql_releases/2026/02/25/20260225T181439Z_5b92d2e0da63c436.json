To improve\nperformance, the extension supports parallel static masking using PostgreSQL\nbackground workers.</p>\n<p>Instead of using <code>anon.anonymize_database()</code>, you can use the parallel version:</p>\n<p><code>sql\nSELECT anon.anonymize_database_parallel(4);</code></p>\n<p>The parameter specifies the number of parallel workers to use. The function will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Analyze the foreign key relationships between tables</li>\n<li>Group tables to avoid constraint violations</li>\n<li>Distribute the work across multiple background workers</li>\n<li>Process tables in parallel where possible</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This feature was added by Pierre-Marie Petit.</p>\n<h2>JSON Import / Export</h2>\n<p>When a masking policy contains a lot of rules, it can be difficult to maintain\nthem as a long list of Security Labels. To simplify thinks and help automating\nthe management of masking rules, rules can now be imported and exported in\nJSON format via the functions :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>anon.export_current_database_rules(policy text DEFAULT 'anon')</code></li>\n<li><code>anon.export_roles_rules(policy text DEFAULT 'anon')</code></li>\n<li><code>anon.import_database_rules(database_rules jsonb, policy text DEFAULT 'anon')</code></li>\n<li><code>anon.import_roles_rules(role_rules jsonb, policy text DEFAULT 'anon'</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since roles are instance wide objects they must be managed separately.</p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Benoit Lobréau.</p>\n<h2>Important Security Updates</h2>\n<p>Version 3.0 includes fixes for 2 critical vulnerabilities allowing users to\ngain superuser privileges under certain circumstances. The risk is very high\non PostgreSQL 14 and on instances upgraded from PostgreSQL 14 and earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>All users should upgrade the extension to version 3.0 as soon as possible.</strong></p>\n<p>If a quick upgrade is not possible, the workaround below can mitigate the risk:</p>\n<pre><code>REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;\nDROP FUNCTION anon.get_tablesample_ratio(OID);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more details see <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/issues/616\">issue 616</a> (CVE-2026-2360) and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/issues/617\">issue 617</a> (CVE-2026-2361).</p>\n<h2>Deprecations and Removed Features</h2>\n<p>This major comes with a series of breaking changes, in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PostgreSQL 13 is not supported anymore</li>\n<li>Legacy Static Masking was deprecated since version 2.0 and it is now fully removed</li>\n<li>The <code>anon.pg_masking_rules</code> view is replaced by <code>anon.{all|sys|user}_rules</code></li>\n<li>Support for RHEL 8 is now deprecated and we plan to fully remove it in\n  version 4.0 in 2027</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For upgrade instructions, please refer to the <a href=\"https://postgresql-anonymizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/UPGRADE/\">UPGRADE</a> section in the\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>This release also includes code, bugfixes, documentation, code reviews and ideas\nfrom Pierre-Marie Petit, Benoit Lobréau, Robin Portigliatti, Ludovic Gilbon\nand other <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/blob/master/AUTHORS.md\">contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>We would like to thanks the people at <a href=\"https://www.efluid.com/\">Efluid</a> who helped us with their ideas,\ncomments and testing.</p>\n<p>And also special thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx\">PGRX</a> team for their amazing work!</p>\n<h2>Join our community to improve data privacy!</h2>\n<p>PostgreSQL Anonymizer is part of the <a href=\"https://labs.dalibo.com\">Dalibo Labs</a> initiative.

The issues listed below affect PostgreSQL 18. Some of these issues may\nalso affect other supported versions of PostgreSQL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix inconsistent case-insensitive text matching in the <code>ltree</code> extension. If\nyou use an index on an <code>ltree</code> column, in some cases you may need perform a\nreindex. See the \"Updating\" section for additional instructions.</li>\n<li>Executing <code>ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT</code> to add a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint on\na column that already is marked as <code>NOT NULL</code> now requires the constraint name\nto match the existing constraint name.</li>\n<li>Fix trigger behavior when <code>MERGE</code> is executed from a <code>WITH</code> query to include\nrows affected by the <code>MERGE</code>.</li>\n<li>Several query planner fixes.</li>\n<li>Fix for text substring search for non-deterministic collations.</li>\n<li>Several fixes for <code>NOTIFY</code> error handling and reporting.</li>\n<li>Use the correct ordering function in GIN index parallel builds.</li>\n<li>Fix incorrect handling of incremental backups with tables larger than 1GB.</li>\n<li>Fail recovery if WAL does not exist back to the redo point indicated by the\ncheckpoint record.</li>\n<li>Fix for <code>ALTER PUBLICATION</code> to ensure event triggers contain all set options.</li>\n<li>Several fixes around replication slot initialization.</li>\n<li>Don't advance replication slot after a logical replication parallel worker\napply failure to prevent transaction loss on the subscriber.</li>\n<li>Fix error reporting for SQL/JSON path type mismatches.</li>\n<li>Fix JIT compilation function inlining when using LLVM 17 or later.</li>\n<li>Add new server parameter <code>file_extend_method</code> to control use of\n<code>posix_fallocate()</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix <code>psql</code> tab completion for the <code>VACUUM</code> command options.</li>\n<li>Fix <code>pg_dump</code> to handle concurrent sequence drops gracefully and to fail if\nthe calling user explicitly lacks privileges to read the sequence.</li>\n<li>Several fixes for <code>amcheck</code> around <code>btree</code> inspection.</li>\n<li>Avoid crash in <code>pg_stat_statements</code> when an <code>IN</code> list contains both constants\nand non-constant expressions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also updates time zone data files to tzdata release 2025c, which\nonly has a historical data change for pre-1976 timestamps in Baja California.</p>\n<h2>Updating</h2>\n<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,\nusers are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code>\nin order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and\nupdate its binaries.</p>\n<p>If you have indexes on <code>ltree</code> columns and do not use the <code>libc</code> collation\nprovider, after upgrading to the latest version, you must reindex any\n<code>ltree</code> column. You can use <code>REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to minimize the impact\non your system.</p>\n<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional\npost-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for\ndetails.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/download/\">Download</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/\">Release Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/\">Security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/\">Versioning Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/\">Submit a Bug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/donate/\">Donate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have corrections or suggestions for this release announcement, please send them to the <em>pgsql-www@lists.postgresql.org</em> public <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/list/\">mailing list</a>.</p>",
