The issues listed below affect PostgreSQL 18. Some of these issues may\nalso affect other supported versions of PostgreSQL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix inconsistent case-insensitive text matching in the <code>ltree</code> extension. If\nyou use an index on an <code>ltree</code> column, in some cases you may need perform a\nreindex. See the \"Updating\" section for additional instructions.</li>\n<li>Executing <code>ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT</code> to add a <code>NOT NULL</code> constraint on\na column that already is marked as <code>NOT NULL</code> now requires the constraint name\nto match the existing constraint name.</li>\n<li>Fix trigger behavior when <code>MERGE</code> is executed from a <code>WITH</code> query to include\nrows affected by the <code>MERGE</code>.</li>\n<li>Several query planner fixes.</li>\n<li>Fix for text substring search for non-deterministic collations.</li>\n<li>Several fixes for <code>NOTIFY</code> error handling and reporting.</li>\n<li>Use the correct ordering function in GIN index parallel builds.</li>\n<li>Fix incorrect handling of incremental backups with tables larger than 1GB.</li>\n<li>Fail recovery if WAL does not exist back to the redo point indicated by the\ncheckpoint record.</li>\n<li>Fix for <code>ALTER PUBLICATION</code> to ensure event triggers contain all set options.</li>\n<li>Several fixes around replication slot initialization.</li>\n<li>Don't advance replication slot after a logical replication parallel worker\napply failure to prevent transaction loss on the subscriber.</li>\n<li>Fix error reporting for SQL/JSON path type mismatches.</li>\n<li>Fix JIT compilation function inlining when using LLVM 17 or later.</li>\n<li>Add new server parameter <code>file_extend_method</code> to control use of\n<code>posix_fallocate()</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix <code>psql</code> tab completion for the <code>VACUUM</code> command options.</li>\n<li>Fix <code>pg_dump</code> to handle concurrent sequence drops gracefully and to fail if\nthe calling user explicitly lacks privileges to read the sequence.</li>\n<li>Several fixes for <code>amcheck</code> around <code>btree</code> inspection.</li>\n<li>Avoid crash in <code>pg_stat_statements</code> when an <code>IN</code> list contains both constants\nand non-constant expressions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also updates time zone data files to tzdata release 2025c, which\nonly has a historical data change for pre-1976 timestamps in Baja California.</p>\n<h2>Updating</h2>\n<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,\nusers are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code>\nin order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and\nupdate its binaries.</p>\n<p>If you have indexes on <code>ltree</code> columns and do not use the <code>libc</code> collation\nprovider, after upgrading to the latest version, you must reindex any\n<code>ltree</code> column. You can use <code>REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY</code> to minimize the impact\non your system.</p>\n<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional\npost-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for\ndetails.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/download/\">Download</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/\">Release Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/\">Security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/\">Versioning Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/\">Submit a Bug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/donate/\">Donate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have corrections or suggestions for this release announcement, please send them to the <em>pgsql-www@lists.postgresql.org</em> public <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/list/\">mailing list</a>.</p>",

By using this extension, we can define a set of rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>allow a specific set of credentials</li>\n<li>reject a certain type of credentials</li>\n<li>deny password that can be easily cracked</li>\n<li>enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password</li>\n<li>define a password reuse policy</li>\n<li>define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is banned</li>\n<li>define a delay on authentication failures</li>\n<li>force users to change their password after first login</li>\n<li>throw a warning N days before when the password user is about to expire</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Release 4.5 has been published, it fixes several issues reported by users since last release.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix error cannot change data type of view column \"roleid\" from oid to regrole.</li>\n<li>Add missing upgrade SQL file from 4.3 to 4.4.</li>\n<li>Fix error when the user want to modify his password and\n    credcheck.password_valid_until option is set.  As we modify\n    the VALID UNTIL clause it will generate an error message when\n    the user changes his password:\n         Only roles with the CREATEROLE attribute and the ADMIN\n         option on role \"...\" may alter this role.</li>\n<li>Set the tzp argument in timestamp2tm() call to apply timezone to converted\n    timestamp.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upgrade require a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck library.</p>\n<p>Complete list of changes and acknowledgements are available <a href=\"https://github.com/HexaCluster/credcheck/releases/tag/v4.5\">here</a></p>\n<h2>Links &amp; Credits</h2>\n<p>credcheck is an open project under the PostgreSQL license maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/HexaCluster/credcheck/\">HexaCluster</a>.\nAny contribution to build a better tool is welcome.
