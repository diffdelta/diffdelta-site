Destructive statements (e.g.\nDROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN) are highlighted in red, warning-level statements\n(e.g. DROP FUNCTION, DROP VIEW) in amber, with icons and glyph markers in\nthe SQL editor. A summary banner shows the total count so nothing is\nmissed.</p>\n<p><strong>Hover to preview differences</strong> — Hovering over any row in the statement\nlist shows a floating diff popover with the before and after SQL\nside-by-side, without leaving the script screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Deployment script section headers</strong> — Generated scripts now group\nstatements by object type (Tables, Views, Functions, Indexes, etc.) with\nclickable section headers in the statement list.

Some of these issues may also affect other supported versions of PostgreSQL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issue where a standby would halt and return an error <code>\"could not access status of transaction\"</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix error where the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html#id-1.5.8.10.5.2.2.17.1.1.1\"><code>substring()</code></a> function would raise an error <code>\"invalid byte sequence for encoding\"</code> on non-ASCII text values if the source of that value is a database column. This was due to a change introduced for the fix to <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2026-2006/\"><code>CVE-2026-2006</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Fix for the <code>strict_word_similarity</code> function in <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html\"><code>pg_trgm</code></a> that could lead to incorrect output or crashes. This was due to an oversight in the fix for <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2026-2007/\">CVE-2026-2007</a>.</li>\n<li>Fix function volatility for <code>json_strip_nulls()</code> and <code>jsonb_strip_nulls()</code> to be immutable, like previous releases, allowing for them to be used in indexes. If you previously upgraded to PostgreSQL 18.0 through 18.2, see the additional steps in the \"Updating\" section.</li>\n<li>Fix for <code>NOT NULL</code> tests in <code>LATERAL UNION ALL</code> subquery that could lead to wrong query output.</li>\n<li>Avoid <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints from generating name conflicts with user-written constraints.</li>\n<li>Fix <code>pg_stat_get_backend_wait_event()</code> and <code>pg_stat_get_backend_wait_event_type()</code> to report values for auxiliary processes, similar to <code>pg_stat_activity</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix casting a composite-type variable to a domain type when returning its value from a PL/pgSQL function.</li>\n<li>Fix the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/hstore.html\"><code>hstore</code></a> binary input function to avoid crashes on input with duplicate keys.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Updating</h2>\n<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html\"><code>pg_upgrade</code></a> in order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.</p>\n<p>If you previously upgraded to PostgreSQL 18.0, 18.1 or 18.2, you need to execute the following SQL as a PostgreSQL superuser in all of your databases to make the <code>json_strip_nulls()</code> and <code>jsonb_strip_nulls()</code> functions immutable:</p>\n<p><code>UPDATE pg_catalog.pg_proc SET provolatile = 'i' WHERE oid IN ('3261','3262');</code></p>\n<p>You should also execute this command in the <code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code> databases so future databases you create in your PostgreSQL cluster have the correct function volatility setting. Please see the documentation on <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/manage-ag-templatedbs.html\">template databases</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for details.</p>\n<p>For more details, please see the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/download/\">Download</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/\">Release Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/\">Security</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/\">Versioning Policy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/\">Submit a Bug</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/about/donate/\">Donate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have corrections or suggestions for this release announcement, please send them to the <em>pgsql-www@lists.postgresql.org</em> public <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/list/\">mailing list</a>.</p>",

To improve\nperformance, the extension supports parallel static masking using PostgreSQL\nbackground workers.</p>\n<p>Instead of using <code>anon.anonymize_database()</code>, you can use the parallel version:</p>\n<p><code>sql\nSELECT anon.anonymize_database_parallel(4);</code></p>\n<p>The parameter specifies the number of parallel workers to use. The function will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Analyze the foreign key relationships between tables</li>\n<li>Group tables to avoid constraint violations</li>\n<li>Distribute the work across multiple background workers</li>\n<li>Process tables in parallel where possible</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This feature was added by Pierre-Marie Petit.</p>\n<h2>JSON Import / Export</h2>\n<p>When a masking policy contains a lot of rules, it can be difficult to maintain\nthem as a long list of Security Labels. To simplify thinks and help automating\nthe management of masking rules, rules can now be imported and exported in\nJSON format via the functions :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>anon.export_current_database_rules(policy text DEFAULT 'anon')</code></li>\n<li><code>anon.export_roles_rules(policy text DEFAULT 'anon')</code></li>\n<li><code>anon.import_database_rules(database_rules jsonb, policy text DEFAULT 'anon')</code></li>\n<li><code>anon.import_roles_rules(role_rules jsonb, policy text DEFAULT 'anon'</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since roles are instance wide objects they must be managed separately.</p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Benoit Lobréau.</p>\n<h2>Important Security Updates</h2>\n<p>Version 3.0 includes fixes for 2 critical vulnerabilities allowing users to\ngain superuser privileges under certain circumstances. The risk is very high\non PostgreSQL 14 and on instances upgraded from PostgreSQL 14 and earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>All users should upgrade the extension to version 3.0 as soon as possible.</strong></p>\n<p>If a quick upgrade is not possible, the workaround below can mitigate the risk:</p>\n<pre><code>REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;\nDROP FUNCTION anon.get_tablesample_ratio(OID);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more details see <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/issues/616\">issue 616</a> (CVE-2026-2360) and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/issues/617\">issue 617</a> (CVE-2026-2361).</p>\n<h2>Deprecations and Removed Features</h2>\n<p>This major comes with a series of breaking changes, in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PostgreSQL 13 is not supported anymore</li>\n<li>Legacy Static Masking was deprecated since version 2.0 and it is now fully removed</li>\n<li>The <code>anon.pg_masking_rules</code> view is replaced by <code>anon.{all|sys|user}_rules</code></li>\n<li>Support for RHEL 8 is now deprecated and we plan to fully remove it in\n  version 4.0 in 2027</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For upgrade instructions, please refer to the <a href=\"https://postgresql-anonymizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/UPGRADE/\">UPGRADE</a> section in the\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>This release also includes code, bugfixes, documentation, code reviews and ideas\nfrom Pierre-Marie Petit, Benoit Lobréau, Robin Portigliatti, Ludovic Gilbon\nand other <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer/-/blob/master/AUTHORS.md\">contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>We would like to thanks the people at <a href=\"https://www.efluid.com/\">Efluid</a> who helped us with their ideas,\ncomments and testing.</p>\n<p>And also special thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx\">PGRX</a> team for their amazing work!</p>\n<h2>Join our community to improve data privacy!</h2>\n<p>PostgreSQL Anonymizer is part of the <a href=\"https://labs.dalibo.com\">Dalibo Labs</a> initiative.
