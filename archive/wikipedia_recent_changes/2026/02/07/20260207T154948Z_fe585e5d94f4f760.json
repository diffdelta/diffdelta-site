Steiner's opposition to this order was made unmistakable by his 1912 declaration that no member of the new Order could remain a member of the German Theosophical Society. By the end of that year, Besant had induced the General Council of the Theosophical Society to revoke the charter for the German Section, which was under Steiner's leadership. In February 1913, Steiner and a group of prominent German theosophists founded a new society, the Anthroposophical Society, with the intent of pursuing a more Western path of spirituality than that nurtured in the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref name=Ahern/&gt;{{rp|45}}</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\"></td>\n  <td style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #202122; font-size: 88%; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 4px; border-radius: 0.33em; border-color: #eaecf0; vertical-align: top; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></td>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\"></td>\n  <td style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #202122; font-size: 88%; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 4px; border-radius: 0.33em; border-color: #eaecf0; vertical-align: top; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td class=\"diff-marker\"></td>\n  <td style=\"color: #202122; font-size: 88%; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 4px; border-radius: 0.33em; border-color: #ffe49c; vertical-align: top; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><div>The German branch had numbered only a single Lodge and a few individual members when Steiner became its head in 1902.
