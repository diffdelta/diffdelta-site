Impacted customers may observe degraded performance or delayed telemetry as services continue to recover.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Current Status:</strong>&nbsp;Earlier today, an unexpected interruption to utility power at one of our West US datacenters resulted in a loss of power to parts of the facility. Backup power systems were automatically activated, and power has since been stabilized across the affected areas.</p><p>Following the power event, some infrastructure components experienced temporary unavailability. Our engineers are actively working to restore full connectivity and to validate that services are operating normally. As part of the recovery, we are rebalancing traffic through Azure’s software load balancing (SLB) layer and gradually reintroducing recovered infrastructure once health checks are validated. We continue to closely monitor service health and performance and will provide updates as recovery progresses.</p>",
