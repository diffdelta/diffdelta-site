Impacted customers may observe degraded performance or delayed telemetry as services continue to recover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Current Status: </strong>Earlier today, an unexpected interruption to utility power at one of our West US datacenters resulted in a loss of power to parts of the facility. Backup power systems were automatically activated, and power <strong>has since been stabilized </strong>across the affected areas.</p><p>Following the power event, some infrastructure components experienced temporary unavailability. Network connectivity and management access were restored first to enable recovery operations, after which teams began recovering storage systems and the dependent compute resources. While most infrastructure is now reachable, storage recovery remains in progress, and some compute workloads continue to operate in a degraded state as these dependencies complete recovery.</p><p>Customers may see gradual improvement as services are restored and system health validations continue. A small number of services remain impacted while recovery actions progress, and our engineering and datacenter teams remain actively engaged to monitor stability and ensure a safe return to normal operations.</p>",
