Backup power systems were automatically activated, and power has since been stabilized across the affected areas.</p><p>To ensure service stability, engineers are validating&nbsp;and gradually rebalancing traffic through Azure’s software load balancing layer. Services are being restored in phases as health checks complete. We continue to closely monitor service health and performance and will provide updates as recovery progresses. The next update will be provided within 60 minutes, or as events warrant.</p>",
