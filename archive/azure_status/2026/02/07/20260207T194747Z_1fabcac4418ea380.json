Impacted services include Web Apps, Application Insights, Azure Confidential Compute, Azure Container Registry, Azure Data Factory, Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server, Azure Databricks, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Monitor Essentials, Azure Search, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Backup (MAB), Cloudnet, and Service Bus. Impacted customers may observe degraded performance, reduced availability, or delayed telemetry as services continue to recover.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Current Status: </strong>Earlier today, an unexpected utility power interruption at one of our West US datacenters resulted in a loss of power to portions of the facility. Power has since stabilized, and infrastructure and compute are being restored in controlled phases with continuous validation to ensure a safe and stable recovery.</p><p>During restoration, we identified a single cluster housing two storage stamps that remained in an unhealthy state following initial power and infrastructure recovery. This condition caused data to remain unavailable for dependent components and required additional remediation before broader storage recovery actions could proceed. Restoration efforts for this cluster are ongoing.</p><p>As recovery progresses, we are seeing a continued reduction in the number of unhealthy virtual machines and improvements across resources dependent on impacted storage accounts. Data availability and telemetry recovery are occurring gradually and may take additional time as services rehydrate and backlog processing completes.</p><p><strong>Ongoing Mitigation and Recovery Workstreams: </strong>Our teams are actively engaged in several parallel workstreams to restore full service health. These include continued validation of datacenter power and environmental stability, targeted recovery of the affected storage cluster and associated stamps, and controlled reintroduction of dependent compute and platform services.</p><p>In parallel, we are monitoring virtual machine health, restarting impacted workloads where safe to do so, and validating storage data consistency before re‑enabling full access. Telemetry pipelines are also recovering as services come back online, and customers may continue to see delayed or partial monitoring data until backlog processing completes.</p><p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> At this time, we do not have an estimated time for full resolution. Customers may continue to see incremental signs of recovery as these mitigation efforts progress.</p><p>The next update will be provided within 60 minutes, or sooner if there are significant changes to share.</p>",
