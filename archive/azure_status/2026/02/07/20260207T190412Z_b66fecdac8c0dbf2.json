Impacted customers may observe degraded performance or delayed telemetry as services continue to recover.</p><p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Earlier today, an unexpected utility power interruption at one of our West US datacenters resulted in a loss of power to portions of the facility. Power has stabilized, and infrastructure and compute are being restored in controlled phases with continuous validation to ensure a stable recovery. We identified a single cluster housing 2 storage stamps remained in an unhealthy state after our initial restoration efforts, causing data to remain unavailable and necessitating additional efforts to restore functionality for the dependent component before continued mitigation efforts could be taken to restore the Storage service within the region. Efforts to restore this unhealthy cluster are ongoing. We are seeing significant drops in unhealthy VMs and resources dependent upon storage accounts. Data availability will continue to take time to recover as efforts of full mitigation progress forward. At this time, we have no ETA for full resolution, but customers may begin to see early signs of recovery as we continue to progress further in these efforts. The next update will be provided within 60 minutes, or sooner if significant changes occur.</p>",
