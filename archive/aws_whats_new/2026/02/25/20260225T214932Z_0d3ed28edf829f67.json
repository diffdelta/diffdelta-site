Amazon Bedrock automatically discovers available tools from the gateway, presents them to the model during inference, and executes tool calls server-side when the model selects them, all within a single API call. This eliminates the need for customers to build and maintain client-side tool orchestration loops, reducing application complexity and latency for agentic workflows. Customers retain full control over tool access through their existing AgentCore Gateway configurations and AWS IAM permissions.</p> \n<p>Server-side tool execution with AgentCore Gateway supports all models available through the Amazon Bedrock Responses API. Customers define tools using the MCP server connector type with their gateway ARN, and Amazon Bedrock handles tool discovery, model-driven tool selection, execution, and result injection automatically. Multiple tool calls within a single conversation turn are supported, and tool results are streamed back to the client in real time.</p> \n<p>This capability is generally available in all AWS Regions where both Amazon Bedrock's Responses API and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway are available.

Kiro Powers is a repository of curated and pre-packaged Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, steering files, and hooks validated by Kiro partners to accelerate specialized software development and deployment use cases.<br /> <br /> The AWS Observability power packages four specialized MCP servers with targeted observability guidance: the CloudWatch MCP server for observability data; the Application Signals MCP server for application performance monitoring; the CloudTrail MCP server for security analysis and compliance; and the AWS Documentation MCP server for contextual reference access. This unified platform gives Kiro agents instant context for comprehensive workflows including alarm response, anomaly detection, distributed tracing, SLO compliance monitoring, and security investigation. Additionally, the power includes automated gap analysis that helps you identify and fix missing instrumentation.<br /> <br /> With the AWS Observability power, developers can now accelerate troubleshooting their distributed applications and infrastructure in minutes, directly in their IDE. The power addresses two critical needs: reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) for active incidents and proactively improving your observability stack. For faster incident response, when investigating an active alarm, the power dynamically loads relevant guidance and operational signals so AI agents receive only the context needed for the specific troubleshooting task at hand. For stack improvement, the automated gap analysis examines your code to identify missing instrumentation patterns—such as unlogged errors, missing correlation IDs, or absent distributed tracing—and provides actionable recommendations. The power includes eight comprehensive steering guides covering incident response, alerting, performance monitoring, security auditing, and gap analysis.<br /> <br /> The AWS Observability power is available for <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/aws-observability\">one-click installation</a> within <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/powers/#how-do-i-install-powers\">Kiro IDE</a> and <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/powers/\">Kiro powers webpage</a> in all AWS Regions, with each underlying MCP server functional based on regional support of the corresponding AWS service.

For example, sports broadcasters can automatically generate vertical highlight clips during live games and distribute them to social platforms in real-time, capturing viral moments as they happen rather than hours later.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The service launches with two AI features: vertical video cropping that transforms live and on-demand landscape broadcasts into mobile-optimized formats, and advanced metadata analysis that&nbsp;identifies&nbsp;key moments to generate highlight clips from live content. Using an agentic AI application that requires no prompts or human-in-the-loop intervention, broadcasters can&nbsp;scale&nbsp;content production without adding manual workflows or production staff—the system automatically&nbsp;adapts&nbsp;content for each platform.&nbsp;In beta testing, large media companies achieved 34% or more savings on AI-powered live video workflows compared to using multiple point solutions.</p> \n<p>AWS Elemental Inference is available in&nbsp;the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS Regions</a>:&nbsp;US East (N.

With this launch, AWS WAF Bot Control expands its detection coverage to track more than 650 unique bots and agents, offering one of the most comprehensive AI bot detection catalogs available.<br /> <br /> AI-powered bots and autonomous agents are rapidly reshaping web traffic patterns. AI search crawlers index content, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems fetch data in real time, and autonomous agents execute multi-step tasks across APIs and web applications. Without clear visibility, this traffic can increase infrastructure costs, affect application performance, and access content in ways that may not align with your organization’s security or business policies.<br /> <br /> <br /> The AI traffic analysis dashboard provides a centralized view of AI bot and agent traffic across your protected resources. You can visualize AI traffic trends over time, identify the most active bots and frequently accessed paths, analyze request volumes by bot category and verification status, and take action directly using AWS WAF Bot Control rules, such as allowing verified AI search crawlers while rate-limiting or blocking unverified agents.<br /> <br /> AWS WAF Bot Control's detection catalog now covers more than 650 unique bots and agents spanning categories including AI search engine crawlers, AI data collectors, AI assistants, and large language model training crawlers. The catalog is continuously updated, enabling customers to identify newly emerging AI bots as they appear.<br /> <br /> For customers on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/\">flat-rate pricing plans</a>, the dashboard is included with all paid plans. For WAF customers not subscribed to flat-rate plans, the AI traffic analysis dashboard is available at no additional cost. Refer to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/\">WAF pricing</a> for details.<br /> <br /> The new dashboard and expanded detection capabilities are available in all AWS Regions where AWS WAF is available.<br /> <br /> To get started, visit the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/\">AWS WAF console</a> or explore the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-bot-control.html\">AWS WAF Bot Control documentation</a>.</p>",

All new and renewed public certificates will by default have a validity of 198 days. Existing certificates with 395 days validity continue to be valid and can be used until they renew or expire. All other certificate functionality remains in place. ACM will still continue to auto renew the certificates before expiry. The certificates are now renewed 45 days before expiry. Existing 398 day validity certificates will renew 60 days before expiry and will renew with 198 days validity period.<br /> <br /> We have reduced the pricing for ACM’s exportable public certificates in line with the shorter validity period. 198-day exportable public certificate will now cost $7/Fully Qualified domain name (down from $15) and $79/ wildcard name (down from $149).

With the Kiro power for Aurora DSQL, agents have instant access to specialized knowledge, so developers can work confidently without any prior context, reducing trial-and-error development cycles. The power is available within the <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/amazon-aurora-dsql/\">Kiro IDE</a> for one-click installation.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://skills.sh/awslabs/mcp/dsql\">Aurora DSQL skill</a> extends the same capabilities to additional AI coding agents through the <a href=\"https://skills.sh/docs/cli\">Skills CLI</a>. Developers can install the skill with a single command and select their preferred agents including Kiro CLI, Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, Roo, OpenCode, and more. When developers work on database tasks, the agent dynamically loads relevant skill guidance, including Aurora DSQL Postgres-compatible SQL patterns, distributed database design, and IAM authentication, eliminating the need to repeatedly provide the same context across conversations.&nbsp;As Aurora DSQL adds new features, future skill releases will include updated patterns and guidance, ensuring that agents always have current best practices.</p> \n<p>For more information on the Aurora DSQL Kiro power and agent skills, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_aurora-dsql-steering.html\">Aurora DSQL steering documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aurora-dsql-mcp-server\">GitHub page</a>.

These capabilities make it easier for developers to improve open-weight model accuracy without requiring deep machine learning expertise or large volumes of labeled data. Reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock automates the end-to-end customization workflow, allowing models to learn from feedback on multiple possible responses using a small set of prompts, rather than traditional large training datasets. Reinforcement fine-tuning enables customers to use smaller, faster, and more cost-effective model variants while maintaining high quality.<br /> <br /> Organizations often struggle to adapt foundation models to their unique business requirements, forcing tradeoffs between generic models with limited performance and complex, expensive customization pipelines that require specialized infrastructure and expertise. Amazon Bedrock removes this complexity by providing a fully managed, secure reinforcement fine-tuning experience. Customers define reward functions using verifiable rule-based graders or AI-based judges, including built-in templates for both objective tasks such as code generation and math reasoning, and subjective tasks such as instruction following or conversational quality. During training, customers can use AWS Lambda functions for custom grading logic, and access intermediate model checkpoints to evaluate, debug, and select the best-performing model, improving iteration speed and training efficiency. All proprietary data remains within AWS’s secure, governed environment throughout the customization process.<br /> <br /> Models supported at this launch are: qwen.qwen3-32b and openai.gpt-oss-20b. After fine-tuning completes, customers can immediately use the resulting fine tuned model for on-demand inference through Amazon Bedrock’s OpenAI-compatible APIs - Responses API and Chat Completions API, without any additional deployment steps.

This capability enables customers to connect to Amazon MSK using both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols, in addition to the existing IPv4-only option. It helps customers modernize applications for IPv6 environments while maintaining IPv4 compatibility, making it easier to meet compliance requirements and prepare for future network architectures.<br /> <br /> Amazon MSK is a fully managed service for Apache Kafka that makes it easier for customers to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka as a data store. Previously, MSK Provisioned and Serverless clusters exclusively utilized IPv4 addressing for all connectivity options. With this new capability, customers can now enable dual-stack connectivity (IPv4 and IPv6) on existing MSK clusters using Amazon MSK Console, AWS CLI, SDK, or CloudFormation by modifying the Network Type parameter for a cluster from IPv4 to dual-stack. Upon successful update, MSK provisions IPv6-enabled network interfaces while maintaining existing IPv4 connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted service. To retrieve new IPv6 bootstrap broker strings for MSK clusters, customers can use the GetBootstrapBrokers API to obtain the necessary connection information. All MSK Provisioned and Serverless clusters will retain IPv4-only connectivity unless explicitly updated.<br /> <br /> Dual-stack connectivity for existing MSK Provisioned and Serverless clusters is now available in all <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS Regions</a> where Amazon MSK is available, at no additional cost.
