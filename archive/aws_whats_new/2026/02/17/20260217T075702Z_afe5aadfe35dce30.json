Previously, this required a two-step process—first copying snapshots to the target Region in a backup vault, then copying them to the logically air-gapped vault in the same Region. Now, you can complete this in one step, achieving faster recovery point objectives (RPOs) while eliminating costs associated with intermediate copies. This streamlined process also removes the need for custom scripts or AWS Lambda functions to monitor intermediate copy status.</p> \n<p>This feature is available for Amazon Aurora, Amazon Neptune and Amazon DocumentDB, in all Regions where AWS Backup supports these databases and logically air-gapped vaults. You can start using this feature today through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDKs.

This CB approval, combined with existing compliance credentials, enables customers to run payment workloads in AWS while helping customers maintain CB compliance.<br /> <br /> Organizations such as acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and issuing banks that are moving workloads to the cloud can rely on AWS Payment Cryptography’s CB approval as part of their compliance frameworks. Organizations processing card payments typically require Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to perform cryptography in a compliant manner. AWS Payment Cryptography provides equivalent functionality in an elastic, scalable service, eliminating the operational burden of procuring and manage standalone payment HSMs. Customers can leverage the service’s shared responsibility model with PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, PCI 3DS, PCI DSS, SOC-2, CSA STAR and ISO27001 certifications as well as the additional CB approval.<br /> <br /> AWS Payment Cryptography is available in the following AWS Regions: Canada (Montreal), US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Paris), Africa (Cape Town) and Asia Pacific (Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Sydney).<br /> <br /> To start using the service, please download the latest AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/\">CLI/SDK</a> and see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">AWS Payment Cryptography</a> user guide for more information including further compliance details.</p>",

          "html": "<p>Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) C8i and C8i-flex instances are available in the Europe (Paris), Canada (Central), and US West (N. California) regions. These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors, available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. These C8i and C8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver up to 20% higher performance than C7i and C7i-flex instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. The C8i and C8i-flex are up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models, and 35% faster for Memcached stores compared to C7i and C7i-flex.<br /> <br /> C8i-flex are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of compute intensive workloads like web and application servers, databases, caches, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, and enterprise applications. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.<br /> <br /> C8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. C8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications.<br /> <br /> To get started, sign in to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Management Console</a>. Customers can purchase these instances via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances.

This enhancement is particularly valuable for healthcare organizations accessing portals with strict IP allowlisting, financial services companies with rigorous egress policies, and enterprises routing traffic through corporate proxy infrastructure that provides auditing and security policy enforcement.<br /> <br /> This feature is available in all fourteen <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agentcore-regions.html\">AWS Regions</a> where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser is available: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), and Europe (Stockholm).<br /> <br /> To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/browser-proxies.html\">Browser Proxies documentation</a>.</p>",

Connecting to a node previously required manually constructing SSM connection strings, while node recovery actions such as reboot and replace required CLI commands — the console now provides a single interface for all node actions.<br /> <br /> With node actions in the console, you can now connect to any node via AWS Systems Manager (SSM). The console provides pre-populated SSM CLI commands with copy-to-clipboard support, and direct SSM session launch in the console. While SageMaker HyperPod clusters already support automatic replacement and reboot of unhealthy instances, there are scenarios such as memory overruns or undetectable hardware degradation that may require manual intervention. Now, node actions in the console provide a consistent approach to manually reboot nodes to recover from transient issues, delete unhealthy nodes, and replace nodes, with batch operations supporting multiple node actions simultaneously, enabling you to resolve node issues in minutes. This capability is especially valuable when running time-sensitive AI training and inference workloads where minimizing downtime is essential.<br /> <br /> This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is supported.

This new capability delivers enhanced cost optimization through a shared compute model that reduces overall OCU expenses while maintaining collection-level security and access controls. Additionally, Collection Groups introduce the ability to specify minimum OCU allocations alongside maximum OCU limits, allowing you to provision compute capacity upfront at startup for more predictable performance.<br /> <br /> Collection Groups are particularly valuable for multi-tenant workloads where different tenants require data encryption with separate KMS keys while still benefiting from shared compute resources. By grouping collections together, you can optimize OCU utilization across workloads, reduce costs through resource sharing, and maintain the security isolation required by different encryption keys. The minimum OCU setting ensures your collections have guaranteed baseline capacity from the moment they start, eliminating cold start delays and providing consistent performance for latency-sensitive applications.<br /> <br /> Collection groups are available in all regions where Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is currently <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/opensearch-service.html\" target=\"_blank\">available</a>.
