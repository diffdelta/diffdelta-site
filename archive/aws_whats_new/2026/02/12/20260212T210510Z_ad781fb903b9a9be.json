Previously, this required a two-step process—first copying snapshots to the target Region in a backup vault, then copying them to the logically air-gapped vault in the same Region. Now, you can complete this in one step, achieving faster recovery point objectives (RPOs) while eliminating costs associated with intermediate copies. This streamlined process also removes the need for custom scripts or AWS Lambda functions to monitor intermediate copy status.</p> \n<p>This feature is available for Amazon Aurora, Amazon Neptune and Amazon DocumentDB, in all Regions where AWS Backup supports these databases and logically air-gapped vaults. You can start using this feature today through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDKs. To get started, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource\">AWS Backup documentation</a>.</p>",

This CB approval, combined with existing compliance credentials, enables customers to run payment workloads in AWS while helping customers maintain CB compliance.<br /> <br /> Organizations such as acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and issuing banks that are moving workloads to the cloud can rely on AWS Payment Cryptography’s CB approval as part of their compliance frameworks. Organizations processing card payments typically require Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to perform cryptography in a compliant manner. AWS Payment Cryptography provides equivalent functionality in an elastic, scalable service, eliminating the operational burden of procuring and manage standalone payment HSMs. Customers can leverage the service’s shared responsibility model with PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, PCI 3DS, PCI DSS, SOC-2, CSA STAR and ISO27001 certifications as well as the additional CB approval.<br /> <br /> AWS Payment Cryptography is available in the following AWS Regions: Canada (Montreal), US East (Ohio, N.

To learn how to setup broker log delivery, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-logging.html\">Amazon MSK broker logs documentation</a>.<br /> <br /> MSK Express brokers are designed to deliver up to three times more throughput per broker, scale up to 20 times faster, and reduce recovery time by 90 percent compared to Standard brokers running Apache Kafka. Express broker logs are supported in all <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS regions</a> where express brokers are available. With Amazon MSK, you spend more time innovating on applications and less time managing clusters. Visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/what-is-msk.html\">Amazon MSK developer guide</a> to get started.&nbsp;</p>",

They are up to 30% faster for PostgreSQL databases, up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, and up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models compared to R7i.<br /> <br /> R8i-flex, our first memory-optimized Flex instances, are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of memory-intensive workloads. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.<br /> <br /> R8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. R8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sap/latest/general/sap-hana-aws-ec2.html\" target=\"_blank\">R8i instances are SAP-certified </a>and deliver 142,100 aSAPS, delivering exceptional performance for mission-critical SAP workloads.<br /> <br /> To get started, sign in to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Management Console</a>.

          "html": "<p>Today, AWS announces the release of Audio Enhancement for Amazon Connect, helping improve audio quality and reliability for voice calls in noisy contact center environments. With this launch, you can enable Audio Enhancement for your agents so that end customers can hear them more clearly, even in the presence of background noise within the contact center environment.<br /> <br /> The Audio Enhancement capability suppresses agent-side background noises and isolates agent voices, removing the effect of background noise and chatter in busy contact center environments. Audio Enhancement offers two specialized modes to match different agent setups. The \"Voice Isolation\" mode suppresses noises as well as background speech within the contact center, while the \"Noise Suppression\" mode only suppresses background noises. Contact center administrators can enable these capabilities for agents through the User Management page and select the appropriate mode based on their equipment and setup. Agents with proper permissions can also adjust their settings directly from the Contact Control Panel to optimize for their current environment.<br /> <br /> The Audio Enhancement capability is available in all commercial <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/regions.html#amazonconnect_region\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Regions</a> where Amazon Connect is offered.<br /> <br /> To learn more about Amazon Connect Audio Enhancement, please see the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/connect/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Connect website</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/what-is-amazon-connect.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

Connecting to a node previously required manually constructing SSM connection strings, while node recovery actions such as reboot and replace required CLI commands — the console now provides a single interface for all node actions.<br /> <br /> With node actions in the console, you can now connect to any node via AWS Systems Manager (SSM). The console provides pre-populated SSM CLI commands with copy-to-clipboard support, and direct SSM session launch in the console. While SageMaker HyperPod clusters already support automatic replacement and reboot of unhealthy instances, there are scenarios such as memory overruns or undetectable hardware degradation that may require manual intervention. Now, node actions in the console provide a consistent approach to manually reboot nodes to recover from transient issues, delete unhealthy nodes, and replace nodes, with batch operations supporting multiple node actions simultaneously, enabling you to resolve node issues in minutes. This capability is especially valuable when running time-sensitive AI training and inference workloads where minimizing downtime is essential.<br /> <br /> This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is supported.

Additionally, Collection Groups introduce the ability to specify minimum OCU allocations alongside maximum OCU limits, allowing you to provision compute capacity upfront at startup for more predictable performance.<br /> <br /> Collection Groups are particularly valuable for multi-tenant workloads where different tenants require data encryption with separate KMS keys while still benefiting from shared compute resources. By grouping collections together, you can optimize OCU utilization across workloads, reduce costs through resource sharing, and maintain the security isolation required by different encryption keys. The minimum OCU setting ensures your collections have guaranteed baseline capacity from the moment they start, eliminating cold start delays and providing consistent performance for latency-sensitive applications.<br /> <br /> Collection groups are available in all regions where Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is currently <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/opensearch-service.html\" target=\"_blank\">available</a>.

The service has added the hourly and data processing discounts on NAT Gateways that are service-chained with Network Firewall secondary endpoints. Additionally, AWS Network Firewall has removed additional data processing charges for Advanced Inspection, which enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection of encrypted network traffic.</p> \n<p>Previously, NAT Gateway discounts were limited to primary Network Firewall endpoints, and customers paid additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection for TLS inspection in select AWS regions. With these improvements, the NAT Gateway discounts now apply when service-chained with both primary and secondary firewall endpoints. Customers also no longer pay the additional data processing charge for Advanced Inspection that ranged from $0.001/GB to $0.009/GB in 13 AWS regions: Middle East (Bahrain), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), EU (Milan), South America (São Paulo), US West (N. California), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Melbourne).</p> \n<p>These changes help to reduce costs for architectures that use Network Firewall's multiple VPC endpoint capability and TLS inspection features. Multiple VPC endpoints allow you to connect 50 VPCs per Availability Zone to a single Network Firewall, helping to reduce operational complexity and lower costs as you protect more VPCs. By removing additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection, customers can now implement TLS inspection more cost-effectively across their network security architecture.</p> \n<p>These pricing improvements are available in all <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS regions</a> where Network Firewall is offered and are applied automatically to eligible configurations. No action is required from customers.</p> \n<p>To learn more, see AWS Network Firewall <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/pricing/\">pricing</a> and the AWS Network Firewall service <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-creating.html\">documentation</a>.</p>",

This capability extends AWS Glue's existing connectivity to 100+ non-AWS data sources through 60+ native connectors and additional options on AWS Marketplace.<br /> <br /> Previously, connecting to proprietary systems or emerging platforms required customers to build custom connectors by providing specialized JARs with the necessary libraries. The new native REST API connector eliminates this complexity, making it easier to integrate data from any REST-enabled source. It reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need to install, update, or manage custom libraries, freeing teams from maintenance burdens. The connector also enhances flexibility, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to new data sources as business needs evolve. It also streamlines ETL management by allowing data engineers to focus on data transformation and business logic rather than spending time building and maintaining connector infrastructure.<br /> <br /> The AWS Glue REST API connector is available in all AWS commercial regions where AWS Glue is available.<br /> <br /> You can start using the AWS Glue REST API connector using AWS Glue APIs, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).
