This CB approval, combined with existing compliance credentials, enables customers to run payment workloads in AWS while helping customers maintain CB compliance.<br /> <br /> Organizations such as acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and issuing banks that are moving workloads to the cloud can rely on AWS Payment Cryptography’s CB approval as part of their compliance frameworks. Organizations processing card payments typically require Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to perform cryptography in a compliant manner. AWS Payment Cryptography provides equivalent functionality in an elastic, scalable service, eliminating the operational burden of procuring and manage standalone payment HSMs. Customers can leverage the service’s shared responsibility model with PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, PCI 3DS, PCI DSS, SOC-2, CSA STAR and ISO27001 certifications as well as the additional CB approval.<br /> <br /> AWS Payment Cryptography is available in the following AWS Regions: Canada (Montreal), US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Paris), Africa (Cape Town) and Asia Pacific (Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Sydney).<br /> <br /> To start using the service, please download the latest AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/\">CLI/SDK</a> and see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">AWS Payment Cryptography</a> user guide for more information including further compliance details.</p>",

Teams deploying to Elastic Beanstalk can now benefit from enhanced automation that handles deployment package creation, S3 uploads, version management, and environment monitoring. The new GitHub Action provides a simplified way to deploy applications to Elastic Beanstalk using declarative configuration in GitHub Actions workflows, offering comprehensive automation for the entire deployment lifecycle. This action automatically creates applications and environments when needed, manages deployment packages with configurable exclusions, and integrates seamlessly with IAM using OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.</p> \n<p>To get started, add the \"aws-elasticbeanstalk-deploy\" action to your GitHub Actions workflow file with configuration parameters for your application deployment. The action supports configuring environment settings and platform versions, optional health monitoring and deployment validation, intelligent retry logic for reliable deployments, and S3 bucket management for deployment artifacts. To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-actions/aws-elasticbeanstalk-deploy/blob/main/README.md\">README</a> for the&nbsp;AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy GitHub action.</p> \n<p>You can use this GitHub Action for your Elastic Beanstalk applications in all commercial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services\">AWS Regions</a> where Elastic Beanstalk is available.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Connecting to a node previously required manually constructing SSM connection strings, while node recovery actions such as reboot and replace required CLI commands — the console now provides a single interface for all node actions.<br /> <br /> With node actions in the console, you can now connect to any node via AWS Systems Manager (SSM). The console provides pre-populated SSM CLI commands with copy-to-clipboard support, and direct SSM session launch in the console. While SageMaker HyperPod clusters already support automatic replacement and reboot of unhealthy instances, there are scenarios such as memory overruns or undetectable hardware degradation that may require manual intervention. Now, node actions in the console provide a consistent approach to manually reboot nodes to recover from transient issues, delete unhealthy nodes, and replace nodes, with batch operations supporting multiple node actions simultaneously, enabling you to resolve node issues in minutes. This capability is especially valuable when running time-sensitive AI training and inference workloads where minimizing downtime is essential.<br /> <br /> This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is supported. You can perform all these node actions in the HyperPod Cluster management page on console.

Now, you can get started with less capacity and make more frequent, fine-grained adjustments to match your workload patterns—with no long-term commitments and cost savings up to 95% for short-duration query workloads.<br /> <br /> Capacity Reservations provides dedicated serverless compute and is ideal for workloads requiring query prioritization and concurrency controls. You pay only for capacity that you reserve and there are no data scanned charges. Reserved capacity works seamlessly with existing Athena queries and workgroups—simply attach workgroups to a reservation and submit queries with no changes in your SQL queries or application code required.<br /> <br /> To learn more, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/capacity-management-creating-capacity-reservations.html\" target=\"_blank\">Athena User Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">Athena pricing</a> page.</p>",

Additionally, Collection Groups introduce the ability to specify minimum OCU allocations alongside maximum OCU limits, allowing you to provision compute capacity upfront at startup for more predictable performance.<br /> <br /> Collection Groups are particularly valuable for multi-tenant workloads where different tenants require data encryption with separate KMS keys while still benefiting from shared compute resources. By grouping collections together, you can optimize OCU utilization across workloads, reduce costs through resource sharing, and maintain the security isolation required by different encryption keys. The minimum OCU setting ensures your collections have guaranteed baseline capacity from the moment they start, eliminating cold start delays and providing consistent performance for latency-sensitive applications.<br /> <br /> Collection groups are available in all regions where Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is currently <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/opensearch-service.html\" target=\"_blank\">available</a>.

The service has added the hourly and data processing discounts on NAT Gateways that are service-chained with Network Firewall secondary endpoints. Additionally, AWS Network Firewall has removed additional data processing charges for Advanced Inspection, which enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection of encrypted network traffic.</p> \n<p>Previously, NAT Gateway discounts were limited to primary Network Firewall endpoints, and customers paid additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection for TLS inspection in select AWS regions. With these improvements, the NAT Gateway discounts now apply when service-chained with both primary and secondary firewall endpoints. Customers also no longer pay the additional data processing charge for Advanced Inspection that ranged from $0.001/GB to $0.009/GB in 13 AWS regions: Middle East (Bahrain), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), EU (Milan), South America (São Paulo), US West (N. California), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Melbourne).</p> \n<p>These changes help to reduce costs for architectures that use Network Firewall's multiple VPC endpoint capability and TLS inspection features. Multiple VPC endpoints allow you to connect 50 VPCs per Availability Zone to a single Network Firewall, helping to reduce operational complexity and lower costs as you protect more VPCs. By removing additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection, customers can now implement TLS inspection more cost-effectively across their network security architecture.</p> \n<p>These pricing improvements are available in all <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS regions</a> where Network Firewall is offered and are applied automatically to eligible configurations. No action is required from customers.</p> \n<p>To learn more, see AWS Network Firewall <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/pricing/\">pricing</a> and the AWS Network Firewall service <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-creating.html\">documentation</a>.</p>",

This capability extends AWS Glue's existing connectivity to 100+ non-AWS data sources through 60+ native connectors and additional options on AWS Marketplace.<br /> <br /> Previously, connecting to proprietary systems or emerging platforms required customers to build custom connectors by providing specialized JARs with the necessary libraries. The new native REST API connector eliminates this complexity, making it easier to integrate data from any REST-enabled source. It reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need to install, update, or manage custom libraries, freeing teams from maintenance burdens. The connector also enhances flexibility, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to new data sources as business needs evolve. It also streamlines ETL management by allowing data engineers to focus on data transformation and business logic rather than spending time building and maintaining connector infrastructure.<br /> <br /> The AWS Glue REST API connector is available in all AWS commercial regions where AWS Glue is available.<br /> <br /> You can start using the AWS Glue REST API connector using AWS Glue APIs, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).

These deployment strategies provide additional confidence during updates by allowing teams to observe application behavior at each traffic-shift step, and integrate with Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically stop or roll back deployments if issues are detected. This is especially valuable for workloads running behind an NLB, such as online gaming backends, financial transaction systems, and real-time messaging services.</p> \n<p>To get started, select your NLB target groups, listener, and preferred deployment strategy in the ECS service configuration using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools.

Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources, and understanding their dependencies is critical for maintaining secure and stable infrastructure.<br /> <br /> Previously, customers managing complex security group configurations had to navigate through multiple AWS services individually to identify dependencies before modifying or deleting security groups.

EKS Pod Identities simplify how Kubernetes applications obtain AWS IAM permissions. With today's launch, you can directly manage EKS Pod Identities using EKS add-ons operations through the EKS console, CLI, API, eksctl, and IAC tools like AWS CloudFormation, simplifying usage of Pod Identities for EKS add-ons. This integration expands the selection of Pod Identity compatible EKS add-ons available for installation through the EKS console during cluster creation.<br /> <br /> EKS add-ons integration with Pod Identities is generally available in AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions.
