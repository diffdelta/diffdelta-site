This capability extends AWS Glue's existing connectivity to 100+ non-AWS data sources through 60+ native connectors and additional options on AWS Marketplace.<br /> <br /> Previously, connecting to proprietary systems or emerging platforms required customers to build custom connectors by providing specialized JARs with the necessary libraries. The new native REST API connector eliminates this complexity, making it easier to integrate data from any REST-enabled source. It reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need to install, update, or manage custom libraries, freeing teams from maintenance burdens. The connector also enhances flexibility, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to new data sources as business needs evolve. It also streamlines ETL management by allowing data engineers to focus on data transformation and business logic rather than spending time building and maintaining connector infrastructure.<br /> <br /> The AWS Glue REST API connector is available in all AWS commercial regions where AWS Glue is available.<br /> <br /> You can start using the AWS Glue REST API connector using AWS Glue APIs, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).

This is especially valuable for workloads running behind an NLB, such as online gaming backends, financial transaction systems, and real-time messaging services.</p> \n<p>To get started, select your NLB target groups, listener, and preferred deployment strategy in the ECS service configuration using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools. This can be enabled for both new and existing ECS services in all AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Regions</a>.

Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources, and understanding their dependencies is critical for maintaining secure and stable infrastructure.<br /> <br /> Previously, customers managing complex security group configurations had to navigate through multiple AWS services individually to identify dependencies before modifying or deleting security groups. This manual process required checking EC2 instances, Elastic Network Interfaces, ElastiCache clusters, RDS databases, and other services one by one, making it time-consuming and error-prone. The \"Related resources\" tab streamlines this workflow by displaying all dependent resources in a single location, enabling customers to quickly assess the impact of proposed changes and make informed decisions with confidence.

This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.<br /> <br /> Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins. These approaches required ongoing operational overhead to rotate secrets, update allow-lists, and maintain custom code. Now with origin mTLS support, customers can implement a standardized, certificate-based authentication approach that eliminates this operational burden. This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs. Customers can leverage client certificates issued by <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html\">AWS Private Certificate Authority</a> or third-party private Certificate Authorities, which they import through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/\">AWS Certificate Manager</a>.<br /> <br /> Customers can configure origin mTLS using the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, CDK, or CloudFormation. Origin mTLS is supported for all origins that support mutual TLS on AWS such as Application Load Balancer and API Gateway, as well as on-premises and custom origins. There is no additional charge for origin mTLS. Origin mTLS is also available in the Business and Premium flat-rate pricing plans. For detailed implementation guidance and best practices, visit the CloudFront origin <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-mtls-authentication.html\">mutual TLS documentation</a>.</p>",

The service has added the hourly and data processing discounts on NAT Gateways that are service-chained with Network Firewall secondary endpoints. Additionally, AWS Network Firewall has removed additional data processing charges for Advanced Inspection, which enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection of encrypted network traffic.</p> \n<p>Previously, NAT Gateway discounts were limited to primary Network Firewall endpoints, and customers paid additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection for TLS inspection in select AWS regions. With these improvements, the NAT Gateway discounts now apply when service-chained with both primary and secondary firewall endpoints. Customers also no longer pay the additional data processing charge for Advanced Inspection that ranged from $0.001/GB to $0.009/GB in 13 AWS regions: Middle East (Bahrain), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), EU (Milan), South America (São Paulo), US West (N. California), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Melbourne).</p> \n<p>These changes help to reduce costs for architectures that use Network Firewall's multiple VPC endpoint capability and TLS inspection features. Multiple VPC endpoints allow you to connect 50 VPCs per Availability Zone to a single Network Firewall, helping to reduce operational complexity and lower costs as you protect more VPCs. By removing additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection, customers can now implement TLS inspection more cost-effectively across their network security architecture.</p> \n<p>These pricing improvements are available in all <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/\">AWS regions</a> where Network Firewall is offered and are applied automatically to eligible configurations. No action is required from customers.</p> \n<p>To learn more, see AWS Network Firewall <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/pricing/\">pricing</a> and the AWS Network Firewall service <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/firewall-creating.html\">documentation</a>.</p>",
