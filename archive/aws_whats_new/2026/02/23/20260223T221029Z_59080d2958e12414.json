These connectors act as transparent authentication layers that automatically handle IAM token generation, eliminating the need to write token generation code or manually supply IAM tokens. Tokens are automatically generated for each connection, ensuring valid tokens are always used while maintaining full compatibility with existing PostgreSQL driver features. The Postgres.js connector additionally supports WebSocket protocol, enabling customers to connect to DSQL clusters in environments where TCP connections are not available.<br /> <br /> These connectors streamline authentication and eliminate security risks associated with traditional user-generated passwords. All three connectors support custom IAM credential providers, giving customers flexibility in how they manage their AWS credentials.<br /> <br /> To get started, visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_connectors.html\">Connectors for Aurora DSQL documentation</a> page.

These integrations bundle the Aurora DSQL Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with development best practices, so AI agents can help you with Aurora DSQL schema design, performance optimization, and database operations out of the box.<br /> <br /> Kiro powers is a registry of curated and pre-packaged MCP servers, steering files, and agent hooks to accelerate specialized software development and deployment use cases. With the Kiro power for Aurora DSQL, agents have instant access to specialized knowledge, so developers can work confidently without any prior context, reducing trial-and-error development cycles. The power is available within the <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/amazon-aurora-dsql/\">Kiro IDE</a> for one-click installation.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://skills.sh/awslabs/mcp/dsql\">Aurora DSQL skill</a> extends the same capabilities to additional AI coding agents through the <a href=\"https://skills.sh/docs/cli\">Skills CLI</a>. Developers can install the skill with a single command and select their preferred agents including Kiro CLI, Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, Roo, OpenCode, and more. When developers work on database tasks, the agent dynamically loads relevant skill guidance, including Aurora DSQL Postgres-compatible SQL patterns, distributed database design, and IAM authentication, eliminating the need to repeatedly provide the same context across conversations.&nbsp;As Aurora DSQL adds new features, future skill releases will include updated patterns and guidance, ensuring that agents always have current best practices.</p> \n<p>For more information on the Aurora DSQL Kiro power and agent skills, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_aurora-dsql-steering.html\">Aurora DSQL steering documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aurora-dsql-mcp-server\">GitHub page</a>.

These capabilities make it easier for developers to improve open-weight model accuracy without requiring deep machine learning expertise or large volumes of labeled data. Reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock automates the end-to-end customization workflow, allowing models to learn from feedback on multiple possible responses using a small set of prompts, rather than traditional large training datasets. Reinforcement fine-tuning enables customers to use smaller, faster, and more cost-effective model variants while maintaining high quality.<br /> <br /> Organizations often struggle to adapt foundation models to their unique business requirements, forcing tradeoffs between generic models with limited performance and complex, expensive customization pipelines that require specialized infrastructure and expertise. Amazon Bedrock removes this complexity by providing a fully managed, secure reinforcement fine-tuning experience. Customers define reward functions using verifiable rule-based graders or AI-based judges, including built-in templates for both objective tasks such as code generation and math reasoning, and subjective tasks such as instruction following or conversational quality. During training, customers can use AWS Lambda functions for custom grading logic, and access intermediate model checkpoints to evaluate, debug, and select the best-performing model, improving iteration speed and training efficiency. All proprietary data remains within AWS’s secure, governed environment throughout the customization process.<br /> <br /> Models supported at this launch are: qwen.qwen3-32b and openai.gpt-oss-20b. After fine-tuning completes, customers can immediately use the resulting fine tuned model for on-demand inference through Amazon Bedrock’s OpenAI-compatible APIs - Responses API and Chat Completions API, without any additional deployment steps.

Upon successful update, MSK provisions IPv6-enabled network interfaces while maintaining existing IPv4 connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted service. To retrieve new IPv6 bootstrap broker strings for MSK clusters, customers can use the GetBootstrapBrokers API to obtain the necessary connection information.

With a maximum frequency of 4.5GHz, Hpc8a instances deliver up to 40% higher performance and up to 25% better price performance compared to Hpc7a instances, helping customers accelerate compute-intensive workloads while optimizing costs.<br /> <br /> <br /> Built on the latest sixth-generation <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro Cards</a>, Hpc8a instances are designed for compute-intensive, latency-sensitive HPC workloads. They are ideal for tightly coupled applications such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), weather forecasting, explicit finite element analysis (FEA), and multiphysics simulations that require fast inter-node communication and consistent high performance.<br /> <br /> Hpc8a instances feature 192 cores, 768 GiB memory and 300 Gbps of Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) network bandwidth, enabling fast, low-latency cluster scaling for large-scale HPC workloads. Compared to Hpc7a instances, Hpc8a instances also provide up to 42% higher memory bandwidth, further improving performance for memory-intensive simulations and scientific computing workloads.<br /> <br /> Hpc8a instances are available today in US East (Ohio) and Europe (Stockholm). Customers can purchase Hpc8a instances via Savings Plans or On-Demand instances.

Additionally, you can now specify or modify the backup retention period and preferred backup window when restoring database instances and clusters, eliminating the need to modify the instance or cluster after restoration.<br /> <br /> These enhancements are available for all Amazon RDS database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and DB2) and Amazon Aurora (MySQL-Compatible and PostgreSQL-Compatible editions) in all AWS commercial regions and AWS GovCloud (US) regions where RDS and Aurora are supported and respective database engines are available. You can use these features through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs at no additional cost.

We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of PostgreSQL, and to benefit from the bug fixes added by the PostgreSQL community. This release also includes new extension pg_stat_monitor that enables you to collect performance metrics and evaluate query performance insights in a unified view.<br /> <br /> You can upgrade your databases during scheduled maintenance windows using automatic minor version upgrades. To simplify operations at scale, enable automatic minor version upgrades and use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/RDS.Maintenance.AMVU.UpgradeRollout.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Organizations Upgrade Rollout Policy</a> to orchestrate thousands of upgrades in phases, first to development environments before upgrading production systems. You can also use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/rds-blue-green-deployments-upgrade-rds-postgresql/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon RDS Blue/Green deployments</a> with physical replication to minimize downtime for minor version upgrades.<br /> <br /> Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL deployments in the cloud. See <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Pricing</a> for pricing details and regional availability.
