These integrations bundle the Aurora DSQL Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with development best practices, so AI agents can help you with Aurora DSQL schema design, performance optimization, and database operations out of the box.<br /> <br /> Kiro powers is a registry of curated and pre-packaged MCP servers, steering files, and agent hooks to accelerate specialized software development and deployment use cases. With the Kiro power for Aurora DSQL, agents have instant access to specialized knowledge, so developers can work confidently without any prior context, reducing trial-and-error development cycles. The power is available within the <a href=\"https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/amazon-aurora-dsql/\">Kiro IDE</a> for one-click installation.<br /> <br /> The <a href=\"https://skills.sh/awslabs/mcp/dsql\">Aurora DSQL skill</a> extends the same capabilities to additional AI coding agents through the <a href=\"https://skills.sh/docs/cli\">Skills CLI</a>. Developers can install the skill with a single command and select their preferred agents including Kiro CLI, Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, Roo, OpenCode, and more. When developers work on database tasks, the agent dynamically loads relevant skill guidance, including Aurora DSQL Postgres-compatible SQL patterns, distributed database design, and IAM authentication, eliminating the need to repeatedly provide the same context across conversations.&nbsp;As Aurora DSQL adds new features, future skill releases will include updated patterns and guidance, ensuring that agents always have current best practices.</p> \n<p>For more information on the Aurora DSQL Kiro power and agent skills, visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_aurora-dsql-steering.html\">Aurora DSQL steering documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aurora-dsql-mcp-server\">GitHub page</a>.

These capabilities make it easier for developers to improve open-weight model accuracy without requiring deep machine learning expertise or large volumes of labeled data. Reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock automates the end-to-end customization workflow, allowing models to learn from feedback on multiple possible responses using a small set of prompts, rather than traditional large training datasets. Reinforcement fine-tuning enables customers to use smaller, faster, and more cost-effective model variants while maintaining high quality.<br /> <br /> Organizations often struggle to adapt foundation models to their unique business requirements, forcing tradeoffs between generic models with limited performance and complex, expensive customization pipelines that require specialized infrastructure and expertise. Amazon Bedrock removes this complexity by providing a fully managed, secure reinforcement fine-tuning experience. Customers define reward functions using verifiable rule-based graders or AI-based judges, including built-in templates for both objective tasks such as code generation and math reasoning, and subjective tasks such as instruction following or conversational quality. During training, customers can use AWS Lambda functions for custom grading logic, and access intermediate model checkpoints to evaluate, debug, and select the best-performing model, improving iteration speed and training efficiency. All proprietary data remains within AWS’s secure, governed environment throughout the customization process.<br /> <br /> Models supported at this launch are: qwen.qwen3-32b and openai.gpt-oss-20b. After fine-tuning completes, customers can immediately use the resulting fine tuned model for on-demand inference through Amazon Bedrock’s OpenAI-compatible APIs - Responses API and Chat Completions API, without any additional deployment steps.

Upon successful update, MSK provisions IPv6-enabled network interfaces while maintaining existing IPv4 connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted service. To retrieve new IPv6 bootstrap broker strings for MSK clusters, customers can use the GetBootstrapBrokers API to obtain the necessary connection information.

They are ideal for tightly coupled applications such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), weather forecasting, explicit finite element analysis (FEA), and multiphysics simulations that require fast inter-node communication and consistent high performance.<br /> <br /> Hpc8a instances feature 192 cores, 768 GiB memory and 300 Gbps of Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) network bandwidth, enabling fast, low-latency cluster scaling for large-scale HPC workloads. Compared to Hpc7a instances, Hpc8a instances also provide up to 42% higher memory bandwidth, further improving performance for memory-intensive simulations and scientific computing workloads.<br /> <br /> Hpc8a instances are available today in US East (Ohio) and Europe (Stockholm). Customers can purchase Hpc8a instances via Savings Plans or On-Demand instances.

For example, if all supervisors need to complete a certain training by end of week, a notification can be published to non-compliant users to remind them.<br /> <br /> The new notification APIs enable you to programmatically send targeted messages to specific audiences within your organization, ensuring teams stay aware of urgent updates, policy changes, and action items requiring immediate attention. Amazon Connect will also leverage this capability to deliver system updates and important announcements.<br /> <br /> In-app notifications are available in all <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/regions.html#amazonconnect_region\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AWS regions\">AWS regions</a> where Amazon Connect is available and offer public API and AWS CloudFormation support.

Additionally, you can now specify or modify the backup retention period and preferred backup window when restoring database instances and clusters, eliminating the need to modify the instance or cluster after restoration.<br /> <br /> These enhancements are available for all Amazon RDS database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and DB2) and Amazon Aurora (MySQL-Compatible and PostgreSQL-Compatible editions) in all AWS commercial regions and AWS GovCloud (US) regions where RDS and Aurora are supported and respective database engines are available.

This CB approval, combined with existing compliance credentials, enables customers to run payment workloads in AWS while helping customers maintain CB compliance.<br /> <br /> Organizations such as acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and issuing banks that are moving workloads to the cloud can rely on AWS Payment Cryptography’s CB approval as part of their compliance frameworks. Organizations processing card payments typically require Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to perform cryptography in a compliant manner. AWS Payment Cryptography provides equivalent functionality in an elastic, scalable service, eliminating the operational burden of procuring and manage standalone payment HSMs. Customers can leverage the service’s shared responsibility model with PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, PCI 3DS, PCI DSS, SOC-2, CSA STAR and ISO27001 certifications as well as the additional CB approval.<br /> <br /> AWS Payment Cryptography is available in the following AWS Regions: Canada (Montreal), US East (Ohio, N.
