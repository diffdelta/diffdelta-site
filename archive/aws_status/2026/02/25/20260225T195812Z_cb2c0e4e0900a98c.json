We have identified the issue to be in an underlying subsystem responsible for publishing EC2 metric data to CloudWatch. Engineers were automatically engaged, and continue to investigate multiple paths to mitigate the issue in parallel. We recommend customers treat the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state as missing data instead of an alarm breach, especially when configuring the alarm to stop, terminate, reboot, or recover an instance. More information is available <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingAlarmActions.html\">here</a>. While we do not have a firm ETA for resolution, we will provide another update by 12:30 PM, or sooner if we have additional information to share.",
