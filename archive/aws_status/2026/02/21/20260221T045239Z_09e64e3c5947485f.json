Our automated deployment takes approximately 12 hours so impact stayed limited to a subset of customers until we began observing broader impact at approximately 3:00 PM PST.  Engineers were engaged and began identifying the root cause. By 4:45 PM PST, we had identified the root cause and began mitigating affected routes. At 5:45 PM PST, all affected routes had been re-advertised and the issue was fully mitigated. During this time, customers may have experienced issues routing between their AWS VPC resources in N.Virginia (US-EAST-1) and their on-premise environments. We do not expect this issue to reoccur.
