It sets a time limited \"warm shutdown\" period, during which the worker will continue to process tasks that are already running. After the soft shutdown ends, the worker will initiate a graceful cold shutdown, stopping all tasks and exiting.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the new configuration option [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout). If a worker is not running any task when the soft shutdown initiates, it will skip the warm shutdown period and proceed directly to the cold shutdown unless the new configuration option [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) is set to True. This is useful for workers that are idle, waiting on ETA tasks to be executed that still want to enable the soft shutdown anyways.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown can replace the cold shutdown when using a broker with a visibility timeout mechanism, like [Redis](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html#soft-shutdown) or [SQS](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/sqs.html#caveats), to enable a more graceful cold shutdown procedure, allowing the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed (e.g., ``Restoring 1 unacknowledged message(s)``) by resetting the visibility timeout of the unacknowledged messages just before the worker exits completely.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Soft Shutdown mechanism.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9213, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9231, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9238\r\n\r\n- New [documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#stopping-the-worker) for each shutdown type.\r\n- New [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout) configuration option.\r\n- New [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) configuration option.\r\n\r\n### REMAP_SIGTERM\r\nThe ``REMAP_SIGTERM`` \"hidden feature\" has been tested, [documented](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#cold-shutdown) and is now officially supported.\r\nThis feature allows users to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, to initiate a soft or a cold shutdown using **TERM**\r\ninstead of **QUIT**.\r\n\r\n### Pydantic Support\r\nThis release introduces support for Pydantic models in Celery tasks.\r\nFor more info, see the new [pydantic example](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/main/examples/pydantic/tasks.py) and PR #9023 by @mathiasertl.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Pydantic support.\r\n\r\n### Redis Broker Stability Improvements\r\nThe root cause of the Redis broker instability issue has been [identified and resolved](https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/2007) in the [v5.4.0](https://github.com/celery/kombu/releases/tag/v5.4.0) release of Kombu, which should resolve the disconnections bug and offer additional improvements.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Redis broker stability.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #7276, #8091, #8030, #8384\r\n\r\n### Quorum Queues Initial Support\r\nThis release introduces the initial support for Quorum Queues with Celery. \r\n\r\nSee new configuration options for more details:\r\n\r\n* [task_default_queue_type](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#task-default-queue-type)\r\n* [worker_detect_quorum_queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#worker-detect-quorum-queues)\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Quorum Queues support.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #6067, #9121\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Bump mypy from 1.13.0 to 1.14.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9476\r\n* Fix

It sets a time limited \"warm shutdown\" period, during which the worker will continue to process tasks that are already running. After the soft shutdown ends, the worker will initiate a graceful cold shutdown, stopping all tasks and exiting.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the new configuration option [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout). If a worker is not running any task when the soft shutdown initiates, it will skip the warm shutdown period and proceed directly to the cold shutdown unless the new configuration option [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) is set to True. This is useful for workers that are idle, waiting on ETA tasks to be executed that still want to enable the soft shutdown anyways.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown can replace the cold shutdown when using a broker with a visibility timeout mechanism, like [Redis](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html#soft-shutdown) or [SQS](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/sqs.html#caveats), to enable a more graceful cold shutdown procedure, allowing the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed (e.g., ``Restoring 1 unacknowledged message(s)``) by resetting the visibility timeout of the unacknowledged messages just before the worker exits completely.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Soft Shutdown mechanism.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9213, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9231, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9238\r\n\r\n- New [documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#stopping-the-worker) for each shutdown type.\r\n- New [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout) configuration option.\r\n- New [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) configuration option.\r\n\r\n### REMAP_SIGTERM\r\nThe ``REMAP_SIGTERM`` \"hidden feature\" has been tested, [documented](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#cold-shutdown) and is now officially supported.\r\nThis feature allows users to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, to initiate a soft or a cold shutdown using **TERM**\r\ninstead of **QUIT**.\r\n\r\n### Pydantic Support\r\nThis release introduces support for Pydantic models in Celery tasks.\r\nFor more info, see the new [pydantic example](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/main/examples/pydantic/tasks.py) and PR #9023 by @mathiasertl.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Pydantic support.\r\n\r\n### Redis Broker Stability Improvements\r\nThe root cause of the Redis broker instability issue has been [identified and resolved](https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/2007) in the [v5.4.0](https://github.com/celery/kombu/releases/tag/v5.4.0) release of Kombu, which should resolve the disconnections bug and offer additional improvements.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Redis broker stability.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #7276, #8091, #8030, #8384\r\n\r\n### Quorum Queues Initial Support\r\nThis release introduces the initial support for Quorum Queues with Celery. \r\n\r\nSee new configuration options for more details:\r\n\r\n* [task_default_queue_type](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#task-default-queue-type)\r\n* [worker_detect_quorum_queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#worker-detect-quorum-queues)\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Quorum Queues support.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #6067, #9121\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Bugfix: SIGQUIT not initiating cold shutdown when `task_acks_late=False` by @Nusnus in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9461\r\n* Fixed pycurl dep with Python 3.8 by @Nusnus in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9471\r\n* Update elasticsearch requirement from <=8.16.0 to <=8.17.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9469\r\n* Bump pytest-subtests from 0.13.1 to 0.14.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9459\r\n* documentation: Added a type annotation to the periodic task example by @Avamander in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9473\r\n* Prepare for (pre) release: v5.5.0rc4 by @Nusnus in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9474\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Avamander made their first contribution in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9473\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/celery/celery/compare/v5.5.0rc3...v5.5.0rc4",

          "body": "Celery v5.5.0 Release Candidate 3 is now available for testing.\r\nPlease help us test this version and [report](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/9140) any issues.\r\n\r\n## Key Highlights\r\n\r\nSee [What’s new in Celery 5.5 (Immunity)](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/history/whatsnew-5.5.html#whatsnew-5-5) or read the main highlights below.\r\n\r\n### Using Kombu 5.5.0rc2\r\n\r\nThe minimum required Kombu version has been bumped to 5.5.0.\r\nKombu is current at [5.5.0rc2](https://github.com/celery/kombu/releases/tag/v5.5.0rc2).\r\n\r\n### Complete Quorum Queues Support\r\n\r\nA completely new ETA mechanism was developed to allow full support with RabbitMQ Quorum Queues.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the quorum queues support.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #9207, #6067\r\n\r\n- New [documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/rabbitmq.html#using-quorum-queues).\r\n- New [broker_native_delayed_delivery_queue_type](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#broker-native-delayed-delivery-queue-type) configuration option.\r\n\r\n### New support for Google Pub/Sub transport\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Google Pub/Sub transport support.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #9351\r\n\r\n### Python 3.13 Improved Support\r\n\r\nAdditional dependencies have been migrated successfully to Python 3.13, including Kombu and py-amqp.\r\n\r\n### Soft Shutdown\r\nThe soft shutdown is a new mechanism in Celery that sits between the warm shutdown and the cold shutdown. It sets a time limited \"warm shutdown\" period, during which the worker will continue to process tasks that are already running. After the soft shutdown ends, the worker will initiate a graceful cold shutdown, stopping all tasks and exiting.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the new configuration option [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout). If a worker is not running any task when the soft shutdown initiates, it will skip the warm shutdown period and proceed directly to the cold shutdown unless the new configuration option [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) is set to True. This is useful for workers that are idle, waiting on ETA tasks to be executed that still want to enable the soft shutdown anyways.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown can replace the cold shutdown when using a broker with a visibility timeout mechanism, like [Redis](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html#soft-shutdown) or [SQS](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/sqs.html#caveats), to enable a more graceful cold shutdown procedure, allowing the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed (e.g., ``Restoring 1 unacknowledged message(s)``) by resetting the visibility timeout of the unacknowledged messages just before the worker exits completely.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Soft Shutdown mechanism.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9213, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9231, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9238\r\n\r\n- New [documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#stopping-the-worker) for each shutdown type.\r\n- New [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout) configuration option.\r\n- New [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) configuration option.\r\n\r\n### REMAP_SIGTERM\r\nThe ``REMAP_SIGTERM`` \"hidden feature\" has been tested, [documented](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#cold-shutdown) and is now officially supported.\r\nThis feature allows users to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, to initiate a soft or a cold shutdown using **TERM**\r\ninstead of **QUIT**.\r\n\r\n### Pydantic Support\r\nThis release introduces support for Pydantic models in Celery tasks.\r\nFor more info, see the new [pydantic example](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/main/examples/pydantic/tasks.py) and PR #9023 by @mathiasertl.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Pydantic support.\r\n\r\n### Redis Broker Stability Improvements\r\nThe root cause of the Redis broker instability issue has been [identified and resolved](https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/2007) in the [v5.4.0](https://github.com/celery/kombu/releases/tag/v5.4.0) release of Kombu, which should resolve the disconnections bug and offer additional improvements.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Redis broker stability.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #7276, #8091, #8030, #8384\r\n\r\n### Quorum Queues Initial Support\r\nThis release introduces the initial support for Quorum Queues with Celery. \r\n\r\nSee new configuration options for more details:\r\n\r\n* [task_default_queue_type](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#task-default-queue-type)\r\n* [worker_detect_quorum_queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#worker-detect-quorum-queues)\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the

          "body": "Celery v5.5.0 Beta 3 is now available for testing.\r\nPlease help us test this version and [report](https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/9140) any issues.\r\n\r\n## Key Highlights\r\n\r\n### Soft Shutdown\r\nThe soft shutdown is a new mechanism in Celery that sits between the warm shutdown and the cold shutdown. It sets a time limited \"warm shutdown\" period, during which the worker will continue to process tasks that are already running. After the soft shutdown ends, the worker will initiate a graceful cold shutdown, stopping all tasks and exiting.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the new configuration option [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout). If a worker is not running any task when the soft shutdown initiates, it will skip the warm shutdown period and proceed directly to the cold shutdown unless the new configuration option [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) is set to True. This is useful for workers that are idle, waiting on ETA tasks to be executed that still want to enable the soft shutdown anyways.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown can replace the cold shutdown when using a broker with a visibility timeout mechanism, like [Redis](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html#soft-shutdown) or [SQS](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/sqs.html#caveats), to enable a more graceful cold shutdown procedure, allowing the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed (e.g., ``Restoring 1 unacknowledged message(s)``) by resetting the visibility timeout of the unacknowledged messages just before the worker exits completely.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Soft Shutdown mechanism.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9213, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9231, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9238\r\n\r\n- New [documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#stopping-the-worker) for each shutdown type.\r\n- New [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout) configuration option.\r\n- New [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) configuration option.\r\n\r\n### REMAP_SIGTERM\r\nThe ``REMAP_SIGTERM`` \"hidden feature\" has been tested, [documented](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#cold-shutdown) and is now officially supported.\r\nThis feature allows users to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, to initiate a soft or a cold shutdown using **TERM**\r\ninstead of **QUIT**.\r\n\r\n## Previous Pre-release Highlights\r\n\r\n### Pydantic Support\r\nThis release introduces support for Pydantic models in Celery tasks.\r\nFor more info, see the new [pydantic example](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/main/examples/pydantic/tasks.py) and PR #9023 by @mathiasertl.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Pydantic support.\r\n\r\n### Redis Broker Stability Improvements\r\nThe root cause of the Redis broker instability issue has been [identified and resolved](https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/2007) in the [v5.4.0](https://github.com/celery/kombu/releases/tag/v5.4.0) release of Kombu, which should resolve the disconnections bug and offer additional improvements.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Redis broker stability.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #7276, #8091, #8030, #8384\r\n\r\n### Quorum Queues Initial Support\r\nThis release introduces the initial support for Quorum Queues with Celery. \r\n\r\nSee new configuration options for more details:\r\n\r\n* [task_default_queue_type](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#task-default-queue-type)\r\n* [worker_detect_quorum_queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#worker-detect-quorum-queues)\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Quorum Queues support.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #6067, #9121\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Added SQS (localstack) broker to canvas smoke tests by @Nusnus in

          "body": "Celery v5.6.0 is now available.\r\n\r\n## Key Highlights\r\n\r\nSee [What's new in Celery 5.6](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/history/whatsnew-5.6.html) for a complete overview or read the main highlights below.\r\n\r\n### Python 3.9 Minimum Version\r\n\r\nCelery 5.6.0 drops support for Python 3.8 (EOL). The minimum required Python version is now 3.9. Users still on Python 3.8 must upgrade their Python version before upgrading to Celery 5.6.0.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this release includes initial support for Python 3.14.\r\n\r\n### SQS: Reverted to `pycurl` from `urllib3`\r\n\r\nThe switch from `pycurl` to `urllib3` for the SQS transport (introduced in Celery 5.5.0 via Kombu) has been reverted due to critical issues affecting SQS users.\r\n\r\nContributed by @auvipy in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9620.\r\n\r\n### Security Fix: Broker Credential Leak Prevention\r\n\r\nFixed a security issue where broker URLs containing passwords were being logged in plaintext by the delayed delivery mechanism. Broker credentials are now properly sanitized in all log output.\r\n\r\nContributed by @giancarloromeo in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9997.\r\n\r\n### Memory Leak Fixes\r\n\r\nTwo significant memory leaks have been fixed in this release:\r\n\r\n**Exception Handling Memory Leak**: Fixed a critical memory leak in task exception handling that was particularly severe on Python 3.11+ due to enhanced traceback data. The fix properly breaks reference cycles in tracebacks to allow garbage collection.\r\n\r\nContributed by @jaiganeshs21 in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9799.\r\n\r\n**Pending Result Memory Leak**: Fixed a memory leak where `AsyncResult` subscriptions were not being cleaned up when results were forgotten.\r\n\r\nContributed by @tsoos99dev in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9806.\r\n\r\n### ETA Task Memory Limit\r\n\r\nNew configuration option `worker_eta_task_limit` to prevent out-of-memory crashes when workers fetch large numbers of ETA or countdown tasks. Previously, workers could exhaust available memory when the broker contained many scheduled tasks.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.conf.worker_eta_task_limit = 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @sashu2310 in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9853.\r\n\r\n### Queue Type Selection for Auto-created Queues\r\n\r\nNew configuration options allow specifying the queue type and exchange type when Celery auto-creates missing queues. This is particularly useful for RabbitMQ users who want to use quorum queues with auto-created queues.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n\r\n- `task_create_missing_queue_type`: Sets the queue type for auto-created queues (e.g., `quorum`, `classic`)\r\n- `task_create_missing_queue_exchange_type`: Sets the exchange type for auto-created queues\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.conf.task_create_missing_queue_type = 'quorum'\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @ghirailghiro in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9815.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Prepare for release: v5.6.0 by @Nusnus in https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/10010\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/celery/celery/compare/v5.6.0rc2...v5.6.0\r\n",

These improvements significantly enhance stability when using Redis as a broker.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Redis backend now has better exception handling with the new `exception_safe_to_retry` feature, which improves resilience during temporary Redis connection issues. See [Redis backend settings](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#redis-backend-settings) for complete documentation.\r\n\r\nContributed by @drienkop in [#9614](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9614).\r\n\r\n### `pycurl` replaced with `urllib3`\r\n\r\nReplaced the [pycurl](https://pypi.org/project/pycurl/) dependency with [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/).\r\n\r\nWe're monitoring the performance impact of this change and welcome feedback from users who notice any significant differences in their environments.\r\n\r\nContributed by @spawn-guy in Kombu [#2134](https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/2134) and integrated in Celery via [#9526](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9526).\r\n\r\n### RabbitMQ Quorum Queues Support\r\n\r\nAdded support for RabbitMQ's new [Quorum Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues) feature, including compatibility with ETA tasks. This implementation has some limitations compared to classic queues, so please refer to the documentation for details.\r\n\r\n[Native Delayed Delivery](https://docs.particular.net/transports/rabbitmq/delayed-delivery) is automatically enabled when quorum queues are detected to implement the ETA mechanism.\r\n\r\nSee [Using Quorum Queues](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#using-quorum-queues) for complete documentation.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n\r\n- `broker_native_delayed_delivery_queue_type`: Specifies the queue type for delayed delivery (default: `quorum`)\r\n- `task_default_queue_type`: Sets the default queue type for tasks (default: `classic`)\r\n- `worker_detect_quorum_queues`: Controls automatic detection of quorum queues (default: `True`)\r\n\r\nContributed in [#9207](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9207), [#9121](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9121), and [#9599](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9599).\r\n\r\nFor details regarding the 404 errors, see [New Year's Security Incident](https://github.com/celery/celery/discussions/9525).\r\n\r\n### Soft Shutdown Mechanism\r\n\r\nSoft shutdown is a time limited warm shutdown, initiated just before the cold shutdown. The worker will allow `worker_soft_shutdown_timeout` seconds for all currently executing tasks to finish before it terminates. If the time limit is reached, the worker will initiate a cold shutdown and cancel all currently executing tasks.\r\n\r\nThis feature is particularly valuable when using brokers with visibility timeout mechanisms, such as Redis or SQS. It allows the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed before exiting, preventing task loss during worker shutdown.\r\n\r\nSee [Stopping the worker](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#stopping-the-worker) for complete documentation on worker shutdown types.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n\r\n- `worker_soft_shutdown_timeout`: Sets the duration in seconds for the soft shutdown period (default: `0.0`, disabled)\r\n- `worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle`: Controls whether soft shutdown should be enabled even when the worker is idle (default: `False`)\r\n\r\nContributed by @Nusnus in [#9213](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9213), [#9231](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9231), and [#9238](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9238).\r\n\r\n### Pydantic Support\r\n\r\nNew native support for Pydantic models in tasks. This integration allows you to leverage Pydantic's powerful data validation and serialization capabilities directly in your Celery tasks.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\nfrom celery import Celery\r\n\r\napp = Celery('tasks')\r\n\r\nclass ArgModel(BaseModel):\r\n    value: int\r\n\r\nclass ReturnModel(BaseModel):\r\n    value: str\r\n\r\n@app.task(pydantic=True)\r\ndef x(arg: ArgModel) -> ReturnModel:\r\n    # args/kwargs type hinted as Pydantic model will be converted\r\n    assert isinstance(arg, ArgModel)\r\n\r\n    # The returned model will be converted to a dict automatically\r\n    return ReturnModel(value=f\"example: {arg.value}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [Argument validation with Pydantic](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/tasks.html#argument-validation-with-pydantic) for complete documentation.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options:\r\n\r\n- `pydantic=True`: Enables Pydantic integration for the task\r\n- `pydantic_strict=True/False`: Controls whether strict validation is enabled (default: `False`)\r\n- `pydantic_context={...}`: Provides additional context for validation\r\n- `pydantic_dump_kwargs={...}`: Customizes serialization behavior\r\n\r\nContributed by @mathiasertl in [#9023](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9023), [#9319](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9319), and [#9393](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9393).\r\n\r\n### Google Pub/Sub Transport\r\n\r\nNew support for Google Cloud Pub/Sub as a message transport, expanding Celery's cloud integration options.\r\n\r\nSee [Google Pub/Sub Transport](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/gcpubsub.html) for complete documentation.\r\n\r\nFor the Google Pub/Sub support you have to install additional dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip install \"celery[gcpubsub]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen configure your Celery application to use the Google Pub/Sub transport:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbroker_url = 'gcpubsub://projects/project-id'\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @haimjether in [#9351](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9351).\r\n\r\n### Python 3.13 Support\r\n\r\nOfficial support for Python 3.13. All core dependencies have been updated to ensure compatibility, including Kombu and py-amqp.\r\n\r\nThis release maintains compatibility with Python 3.8 through 3.13, as well as PyPy 3.10+.\r\n\r\nContributed by @Nusnus in [#9309](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9309) and [#9350](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9350).\r\n\r\n### REMAP_SIGTERM Support\r\n\r\nThe \"REMAP_SIGTERM\" feature, previously undocumented, has been tested, documented, and is now officially supported. This feature allows you to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, enabling you to initiate a soft or cold shutdown using TERM instead of QUIT.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful in containerized environments where SIGTERM is the standard signal for graceful termination.\r\n\r\nSee [Cold Shutdown documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#cold-shutdown) for more info.\r\n\r\nTo enable this feature, set the environment variable:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport REMAP_SIGTERM=\"SIGQUIT\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @Nusnus in [#9461](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9461).\r\n\r\n### Database Backend Improvements\r\n\r\nNew `create_tables_at_setup` option for the database backend. This option controls when database tables are created, allowing for non-lazy table creation.\r\n\r\nBy default (`create_tables_at_setup=True`), tables are created during backend initialization. Setting this to `False` defers table creation until they are actually needed, which can be useful in certain deployment scenarios where you want more control over database schema management.\r\n\r\nSee [Database backend settings](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#database-backend-settings) for complete documentation.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.conf.result_backend = 'db+sqlite:///results.db'\r\napp.conf.database_create_tables_at_setup = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributed by @MarcBresson in [#9228](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9228).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* (docs): use correct version celery v.5.4.x by @FraCata00 in

It sets a time limited \"warm shutdown\" period, during which the worker will continue to process tasks that are already running. After the soft shutdown ends, the worker will initiate a graceful cold shutdown, stopping all tasks and exiting.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the new configuration option [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout). If a worker is not running any task when the soft shutdown initiates, it will skip the warm shutdown period and proceed directly to the cold shutdown unless the new configuration option [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) is set to True. This is useful for workers that are idle, waiting on ETA tasks to be executed that still want to enable the soft shutdown anyways.\r\n\r\nThe soft shutdown can replace the cold shutdown when using a broker with a visibility timeout mechanism, like [Redis](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/redis.html#soft-shutdown) or [SQS](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/sqs.html#caveats), to enable a more graceful cold shutdown procedure, allowing the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed (e.g., ``Restoring 1 unacknowledged message(s)``) by resetting the visibility timeout of the unacknowledged messages just before the worker exits completely.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Soft Shutdown mechanism.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9213, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9231, https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/9238\r\n\r\n- New [documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#stopping-the-worker) for each shutdown type.\r\n- New [worker_soft_shutdown_timeout](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_soft_shutdown_timeout) configuration option.\r\n- New [worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#std-setting-worker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle) configuration option.\r\n\r\n### REMAP_SIGTERM\r\nThe ``REMAP_SIGTERM`` \"hidden feature\" has been tested, [documented](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#cold-shutdown) and is now officially supported.\r\nThis feature allows users to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, to initiate a soft or a cold shutdown using **TERM**\r\ninstead of **QUIT**.\r\n\r\n### Pydantic Support\r\nThis release introduces support for Pydantic models in Celery tasks.\r\nFor more info, see the new [pydantic example](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/main/examples/pydantic/tasks.py) and PR #9023 by @mathiasertl.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the new Pydantic support.\r\n\r\n### Redis Broker Stability Improvements\r\nThe root cause of the Redis broker instability issue has been [identified and resolved](https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/2007) in the [v5.4.0](https://github.com/celery/kombu/releases/tag/v5.4.0) release of Kombu, which should resolve the disconnections bug and offer additional improvements.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to this version, please share your feedback on the Redis broker stability.\r\n\r\nRelevant Issues: #7276, #8091, #8030, #8384\r\n\r\n### Quorum Queues Initial Support\r\nThis release introduces the initial support for Quorum Queues with Celery. \r\n\r\nSee new configuration options for more
